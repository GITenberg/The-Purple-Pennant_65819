<small>FUDGE IS INTERRUPTED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“‘Keys,’” murmured Fudge Shaw dreamily,
“‘please’—‘knees’—‘breeze’—I’ve used that—‘pease’—‘sneeze’—Oh,
piffle!” His inspired
gaze returned to the tablet before him and he
read aloud the lines inscribed thereon:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O Beauteous Spring, thou art, I ween,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">The best of all the Seasons,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Because you clothe the Earth with green</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And for numerous other reasons.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You make the birds sing in the trees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">The April breeze to blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The Sun to shine——”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“‘The Sun to shine——,’” he muttered raptly,
“‘The Sun to shine’; ‘squeeze’—‘tease’—‘fleas’——
Gee, I wish I hadn’t tried to rhyme all the lines.
Now, let’s see: ‘You make the birds——’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>“O Fudge! Fudge Shaw!”</p>

<p>Fudge raised his head and peered through the
young leaves of the apple-tree in which he was
perched, along the side yard to where, leaning over
the fence, was a lad of about Fudge’s age. The
visitor alternately directed his gaze toward the tree
and the house, for it was Sunday afternoon and
Perry Hull was doubtful of the propriety of hailing
his friend in week-day manner.</p>

<p>“Hello, Perry, come on in!” called Fudge. And
thereupon he detached the “Ode to Spring” from
the tablet, hastily folded it and put it in his pocket.
When Perry climbed the ladder which led to the
platform some eight feet above the ground Fudge
was in the act of closing a Latin book with a tired
air.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” asked Perry. He was
a nice-looking chap of fifteen, with steady dark-brown
eyes, hair a shade or two lighter and a
capable and alert countenance. He swung himself
lithely over the rail instead of crawling under, as
was Fudge’s custom, and seated himself on the
narrow bench beyond the books.</p>

<p>“Sort of studying,” answered Fudge, ostentatiously
shoving the books further away and scowling distastefully
at them. “Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Just moseying around. Peach of a day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>It was. It had rained until nearly dinner time,
and grass and leaves were still beaded with moisture
which an ardent April sun was doing its best to burn
away. It was the first spring-like day in over a
week of typical April weather during which Clearfield
had remained under gray skies. Fudge assented
to Perry’s observation, but it was to be seen
that his thoughts were elsewhere. His lips moved
soundlessly. Perry viewed him with surprise and
curiosity, but before he could demand an explanation
of his host’s abstraction Fudge burst forth triumphantly.</p>

<p>“‘B-b-bees!’” exclaimed Fudge. (Excitement always
caused him to stammer, a fact which his
friends were aware of and frequently made use of
for their entertainment.) Perry involuntarily
ducked his head and looked around.</p>

<p>“Where?” he asked apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Nowhere.” Fudge chuckled. “I was just thinking
of something.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Perry settled back again. “You’re
crazy, I guess. Better come for a walk and you’ll
feel better.”</p>

<p>“Can’t.” Fudge looked gloomily at the books.
“Got to study.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll beat it.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, can’t you? You don’t have to go yet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
I—there isn’t such an awful hurry.” The truth
was that Fudge was not an enthusiastic pedestrian,
a fact due partly to his physical formation and partly
to a disposition contemplative rather than active.
Nature had endowed Fudge—his real name, by the
way, was William—with a rotund body and capable
but rather short legs. Walking for the mere sake
of locomotion didn’t appeal to him. He would
have denied indignantly that he was lazy, and, to
do him justice, he wasn’t. With Fudge it was less
a matter of laziness than discrimination. Give him
something to do that interested him—such as playing
baseball or football—and Fudge would willingly,
enthusiastically work his short legs for all that was
in them, but this thing of deliberately tiring oneself
out with no sensible end in view—well, Fudge
couldn’t see it! He had a round face from which
two big blue eyes viewed the world with a constant
expression of surprise. His hair was sandy-red,
and he was fifteen, almost sixteen, years old.</p>

<p>“It’s too nice a day to sit around and do nothing,”
objected Perry. “Why don’t you get your studying
done earlier?”</p>

<p>“I meant to, but I had some writing to do.”
Fudge looked important. Perry smiled slightly. “I
finished that story I told you about.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” Perry strove to make his question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
sound interested. “Are you going to have it
printed?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” replied the other carelessly. “It’s a pippin,
all right, Perry! It’s nearly fourteen thousand
words long! What do you know about that, son?
Maybe I’ll send it to the <cite>Reporter</cite> and let them publish
it. Or maybe I’ll send it to one of the big New
York magazines. I haven’t decided yet. Dick says
I ought to have it typewritten; that the editors won’t
read it unless it is. But it costs like anything.
Morris Brent has a typewriter and he said I could
borrow it, but I never wrote on one of the things and
I suppose it would take me a month to do it, eh?
Seems to me if the editors want good stories they
can’t afford to be so plaguey particular. Besides,
my writing’s pretty easy reading just as soon as you
get used to it.”</p>

<p>“You might typewrite the first two or three
sheets,” suggested Perry, with a chuckle, “and then
perhaps the editor would be so anxious to know
how it ended he’d keep right on. What are you
going to call it, Fudge?”</p>

<p>Fudge shook his head. “I’ve got two or three
good titles. ‘The Middleton Mystery’ is one of
them. Then there’s ‘Young Sleuth’s Greatest Case.’
I guess that’s too long, eh?”</p>

<p>“I like the first one better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. Then I thought of ‘Tracked by Anarchists.’
How’s that sound to you?”</p>

<p>“‘The Meredith Mystery’ is the best,” replied
Perry judicially.</p>

<p>“‘Middleton,’” corrected Fudge. “Yep, I guess
it’ll be that. I told that fellow Potter about it and
he said if I’d let him take it he’d see about getting
it published in the <cite>Reporter</cite>. He’s a sort of an
editor, you know. But I guess the <cite>Reporter</cite> isn’t
much of a paper, and a writer who’s just starting out
has to be careful not to cheapen himself, you see.”</p>

<p>“Will he pay you for it?” asked Perry.</p>

<p>“He didn’t say. I don’t suppose so. Lots of
folks don’t get paid for their first things, though.
Look at—look at Scott; and—and Thackeray, and—lots
of ’em! You don’t suppose they got paid at
first, do you?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they?” asked Perry in some surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe Thackeray got a few dollars,” hedged
Fudge, “but what was that? Look what he used
to get for his novels afterwards!”</p>

<p>Perry obligingly appeared deeply impressed, although
he secretly wondered what Thackeray <em>did</em>
get afterwards. However, he forebore to ask,
which was just as well, I fancy. Instead, tiring of
Fudge’s literary affairs, he observed: “Well, I
hope they print it for you, anyway. And maybe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
they’ll take another one and pay for that. Say,
aren’t you going out for baseball, Fudge?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going out, I guess, but it won’t do any
good. I don’t intend to sit around on the bench
half the spring and then get fired. The only place
I’d stand any chance of is the outfield, and I suppose
I don’t hit well enough to make it. You going
to try?”</p>

<p>Perry shook his head. “No, I don’t think so. I
can’t play much. Warner Jones told me the other
day that if I’d come out he’d give me a good chance.
I suppose he thinks I can play baseball because I
was on the Eleven.”</p>

<p>“Well, gee, if you could get to first you’d steal all
the other bases, I’ll bet,” said Fudge admiringly.
“You sure can run, Perry!”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, and that makes me think that maybe I
could do something on the Track Team. What do
you think, Fudge?”</p>

<p>“Bully scheme! Go out for the sprints! Ever try
the hundred?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve never run on the track at all. How fast
ought I to run the hundred yards, Fudge, to have a
show?”</p>

<p>“Oh, anything under eleven seconds would do, I
suppose. Maybe ten and four-fifths. Know what
you can do it in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“No, I never ran it. I’d like to try, though.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you? Say, I’ve got a stop-watch in
the house. You wait here and I’ll get it and we’ll go
over to the track and——”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, I couldn’t run in these clothes!”</p>

<p>“Well, you can take your coat and vest off, can’t
you? And put on a pair of sneakers? Of course,
you can’t run as fast, but you can show what you
can do. Perry, I’ll just bet you anything you’ve got
the making of a fine little sprinter! You wait here;
I won’t be a minute.”</p>

<p>“But it’s Sunday, Fudge, and the field will be
locked, and—and you’ve got your lessons——”</p>

<p>“They can wait,” replied Fudge, dropping to the
ground and making off toward the side door.
“We’ll try the two-twenty, too, Perry!”</p>

<p>He disappeared and a door slammed. Perry
frowned in the direction of the house. “Silly
chump!” he muttered. Then he smiled. After all,
why not? He did want to know if he could run,
and, if they could get into the field, which wasn’t
likely, since it was Sunday and the gates would be
locked, it would be rather fun to try it! He wondered
just how fast ten and four-fifths seconds was.
He wished he hadn’t done so much walking since
dinner, for he was conscious that his legs were a bit
tired. At that moment in his reflections there came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
a subdued whistle from the house and Fudge waved
to him.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he called in a cautious whisper. “I’ve
got it. And the sneakers, too.” He glanced a trifle
apprehensively over his shoulder while he awaited
Perry’s arrival and when the latter had joined him
he led the way along the side path in a quiet and unostentatious
manner suggesting a desire to depart
unobserved. Once out of sight of the house, however,
his former enthusiasm returned. “We’ll climb
over the fence,” he announced. “I know a place
where it isn’t hard. Of course, we ought to have a
pistol to start with, but I guess it will do if I just
say ‘Go!’” He stopped indecisively. “Gordon has
a revolver,” he said thoughtfully. “We might borrow
it. Only, maybe he isn’t home. I haven’t seen
him all day.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, we don’t need it,” said Perry, pulling
him along. “He’d probably want to go along
with us, Fudge, and I don’t want any audience. I
dare say I won’t be able to run fast at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, you mustn’t expect too much the first
time,” warned the other. “A chap’s got to be in
condition, you know. You’ll have to train and—and
all that. Ever do any hurdling?”</p>

<p>“No, and I don’t think I could.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t hard once you’ve caught the knack of it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
I was only thinking that if you had plenty of steam
you might try sprints and hurdles both. All we’d
have to do would be to set the hurdles up. I know
where they’re kept. Then——”</p>

<p>“Now, look here,” laughed Perry, “I’m willing to
make a fool of myself trying the hundred-yard dash,
Fudge, but I’m not going to keep you entertained all
the rest of the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll just try the hundred and the
two-twenty.”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t either. We’ll just try the hundred.
Will those shoes fit me? And oughtn’t they to have
spikes?”</p>

<p>“Sure, they ought, but they haven’t. We’ll have
to make allowance for that, I guess. And they’ll
have to fit you because they’re all we’ve got. I guess
you wear about the same size that I do. Here we
are! Now we’ll go around to the Louise Street
side; there’s a place there we can climb easily.”</p>

<small>THE TRY-OUT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The High School Athletic Field—it was officially
known as Brent Field—occupied two
whole blocks in the newer part of town. The
school had used it for a number of years, but only
last summer, through the generosity of Mr. Jonathan
Brent, Clearfield’s richest and most prominent citizen,
had it come into actual possession of the field.
The gift had been as welcome as unexpected and
had saved the school from the difficult task of finding
a new location for its athletic activities. But, unfortunately,
the possession of a large tract of ground
in the best residential part of the town was proving
to have its drawbacks. The taxes were fairly large,
repairs to stands and fences required a constant outlay,
the field itself, while level enough, was far from
smooth, and the cinder track, a make-shift affair at
the beginning, stood badly in need of reconstruction.
Add to these expenses the minor ones of water rent,
insurance on buildings and care-taking and you will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
see that the Athletic Association had something to
think about.</p>

<p>The town folks always spoke of it as “the town,”
although it was, as a matter of fact, a city and
boasted of over seventeen thousand inhabitants—supported
the High School athletic events, notably
football and baseball, generously enough, but it was
already evident to those in charge that the receipts
from gridiron and diamond attractions would barely
keep the field as it was and would not provide money
for improvements. There had been some talk of
an endowment fund from Mr. Brent, but whether
that gentleman had ever said anything to warrant
the rumor or whether it had been started by someone
more hopeful than veracious was a matter for
speculation. At any rate, no endowment fund had
so far materialized and the Athletic Committee’s
finances were at a low ebb. Two sections of grandstand
had been replaced in the fall, and that improvement
promised to be the last for some time,
unless, as seemed improbable, the Committee evolved
some plan whereby to replenish its treasury. Various
schemes had been suggested, such as a public canvass
of the town and school. To this, however, Mr.
Grayson, the Principal, had objected. It was not,
he declared, right to ask the citizens to contribute
funds for such a purpose. Nor would he allow a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
petition to the Board of Education. In fact, Mr.
Grayson as good as said that now that the school had
been generously presented with an athletic field it
was up to the school to look after it. Raising money
amongst the students he had no objection to, but
the amount obtainable in that manner was too small
to make it worth while. The plan of raising the
price of admission to baseball and football from
twenty-five cents to fifty was favored by some, while
others feared that it would keep so many away from
the contests that there would be no profit in it. In
short, the Committee was facing a difficult problem
and with no solution in sight. And the field, from
its patched, rickety, high board fence to grandstands
and dressing-rooms, loudly demanded succor. Fudge
voiced the general complaint when, having without
difficulty mounted the fence and dropped to the
soggy turf inside, followed more lithely by Perry
Hull, he viewed the cinder track with disfavor. The
recent rain had flooded it from side to side, and,
since it was lower than the ground about it and
had been put down with little or no provision for
drainage, inch-deep puddles still lingered in the numerous
depressions.</p>

<p>“We can’t practice here,” said Perry.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that agonize you?” demanded Fudge.
“Gee, what’s the good of having an athletic field<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
if you can’t keep it up? This thing is g-g-going to
be a regular w-w-white elephant!”</p>

<p>“It looks pretty soppy, doesn’t it?” asked Perry.
“I guess we’d better wait until it’s drier. I don’t
mind running, but I wasn’t counting on having to
swim!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s better on the straightaway,” responded
Fudge more cheerfully. “We’ll go over
and see.”</p>

<p>As luck had it, it was drier on the far side of the
field, and Fudge advanced the plea that by keeping
close to the outer board Perry could get along without
splashing much. Perry, however, ruefully considered
his Sunday trousers and made objections.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t mud,” urged Fudge. “It’s just a
little water. That won’t hurt your trousers a bit.
And you can reef them up some, too. Be a sport,
Perry! Gee, I’d do it in a minute if I could!”</p>

<p>“Guess that’s about what I’ll do it in,” said the
other. “Well, all right. Here goes. Give me the
sneakers.”</p>

<p>“Here they are. Guess we’d better go down to
the seats and change them, though. It’s too damp
to sit down here.”</p>

<p>So they walked to the grandstand at the turn and
Perry pulled off his boots and tried the sneakers
on. They were a little too large, but he thought they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
would do. Fudge suggested stuffing some paper in
the toes, but as there was no paper handy that plan
was abandoned. Perry’s hat, coat and vest were
laid beside his boots and he turned up the bottoms of
his trousers. Then they walked along the track,
skirting puddles or jumping over them. Fortunately,
they had the field to themselves, thanks to locked
gates, something Perry was thankful for when
Fudge, discouraging his desire to have the event
over with at once, insisted that he should prance up
and down the track and warm up.</p>

<p>“You can’t run decently until you’ve got your
legs warm and your muscles limber,” declared
Fudge wisely. “And you’d better try a few starts,
too.”</p>

<p>So, protestingly, Perry danced around where
he could find a dry stretch, lifting his knees high
in the manner illustrated by Fudge, and then allowed
the latter to show him how to crouch for the
start.</p>

<p>“Put your right foot up to the line,” instructed
Fudge. “Here, I’ll scratch a line across for you.
There. Now put your foot up to that—your <em>right</em>
foot, silly! That’s your left! Now put your left
knee alongside it and your hands down. That’s it,
only you want to dig a bit of a hole back there for
your left foot, so you’ll get away quick. Just scrape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
out the cinders a little. All right. Now when I
say ‘Set,’ you come up and lean forward until the
weight comes on your front foot and hands; most
on your foot; your hands are just to steady yourself
with. That’s the trick. Now then; ‘On your
mark!’ Wait! I didn’t say ‘Set!’”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, cut out the trimmings,” grumbled
Perry. “I can’t stay like this forever. Besides, I’d
rather start on the other foot, anyway.”</p>

<p>“All right; some fellows do,” replied Fudge, untroubled,
neglecting to explain that he had made
a mistake. Perry made the change and expressed
his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“That’s more like it. Say, how do you happen to
know so much about it, Fudge?”</p>

<p>“Observation, son. Now, all right? Ready to
try it? Set!... Go!”</p>

<p>Perry went, but he stumbled for the first three or
four steps and lost his stride completely.</p>

<p>“You had your weight on your hands instead of
your feet,” commented the instructor. “Try it
again.”</p>

<p>He tried it many times, at last becoming quite
interested in the problem of getting away quickly and
steadily, and finally Fudge declared himself satisfied.
“Now I’ll stand back here a ways where I can start
you and at the same time see when you cross the line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
down there. Of course, we ought to have another
fellow here to help, but I guess I can manage all
right.” He set his stop-watch, composed his features
into a stern frown and retired some twenty
yards back from the track and half that distance
nearer the finish line. “On your mark!” called
Fudge. “Set!... Go!”</p>

<p>Perry sped from the mark only to hear Fudge’s
arresting voice. “Sorry, Perry, but I forgot to
start the watch that time. Try it again.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fine trick! I had a bully getaway,”
complained the sprinter. “Make it good this time,
Fudge; I’m getting dog-tired!”</p>

<p>“I will. Now, then! <a href="#i_fp018">On your mark!... Set!...
Go!</a>”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp018">
  <img src="images/i_fp018.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_17">“‘On your mark!... Set!... Go!’”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Off leaped Perry again, not quite so nicely this
time, and down the wet path he sped, splashing
through the puddles, head back, legs twinkling.
And, as though trying to make pace for him, Fudge
raced along on the turf in a valiant endeavor to
judge the finish. Perry’s Sunday trousers made a
gray streak across the line, Fudge pressed convulsively
on the stem of the watch and the trial
was over!</p>

<p>“Wh-what was it?” inquired Perry breathlessly
as he walked back. Fudge was staring puzzledly at
the dial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“I made it twelve seconds,” he responded dubiously.</p>

<p>“Twelve! And you said I’d ought to do it under
eleven!” Perry viewed him discouragedly.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I didn’t snap it just when I should
have,” said the timer. “It’s hard to see unless you’re
right at the line.”</p>

<p>“You must have! I’ll bet anything I did it better
than twelve. Don’t you think I did?”</p>

<p>“Well, it looked to me as if you were going pretty
fast,” answered Fudge cautiously. “But those trousers,
and not having any spikes, and the track being
so wet—Gee, but you did get splashed, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” replied Perry, observing his
trousers disgustedly. “The water even went into
my face! Say, let’s try it again, Fudge, and you
stand here at the finish.”</p>

<p>“All right, but how’ll I start you?”</p>

<p>“Wave a handkerchief or something?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it. I’ll clap a couple of sticks together.”
So Fudge set out to find his sticks while Perry,
rather winded, seated himself on the stand. Fudge
finally came back with the required articles and
Perry declared himself rested and ready for another
trial. “I’ll clap the sticks together first for you
to get set and then for the start. Like this.” Fudge
illustrated. “Suppose you can hear it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“Sure.” Perry proceeded back to the beginning
of the straightaway and Fudge stationed himself at
the finish, scuffling a line across the track for his
better guidance. Then, while the sprinter was getting
his crouch, he experimented with slapping the
sticks and snapping the watch at the same instant,
a rather difficult proceeding.</p>

<p>“All ready!” shouted Perry, poised on finger-tips
and knee.</p>

<p>“All right!” called Fudge in response. He examined
his watch, fixed a finger over the stem, took
a deep breath and clapped the sticks. Perry set.
Another clap and a simultaneous jab at the watch,
and Perry was racing down the track. Fudge’s eyes
took one fleeting look at the runner and then fixed
themselves strainedly on the line he had drawn
across the cinders. Nearer and nearer came the
<em>scrunch</em> of the flying sneakers, there was a sudden
blur of gray in Fudge’s vision and he snapped
the watch. Perry turned and trotted anxiously
back.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Better,” replied Fudge. “Of course, the track’s
awfully slow——”</p>

<p>“How much? Let’s see?”</p>

<p>Fudge yielded the watch and Perry examined it.
“Eleven and two-fifths!” he shouted protestingly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
“Say, this thing’s crazy! I know mighty well I
didn’t run nearly so fast as I did the first time!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t snap it soon enough the other time,”
explained Fudge. “Honest, Perry, eleven and two-fifths
isn’t half bad. Why, look at the slow track
and your long trousers——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they weigh a ton, they’re so wet,”
grumbled Perry. “And so do these shoes. I’m
going to try it some time when the track’s dry
and I’ve got regular running things on. I suppose
eleven and two-fifths <em>isn’t</em> terribly bad, considering!”</p>

<p>“Bad! It’s mighty good,” said Fudge warmly.
“Why, look here, Perry, if you can do it in that
time to-day you can do it nearly a second faster on
a dry track and—and all! You see if you can’t.
I’ll bet you you’ll be a regular sprinter by the time
we meet Springdale!”</p>

<p>“Honest, Fudge?”</p>

<p>“Honest to goodness! To-morrow you put your
name down for the Track Team and get yourself
some running things. I’ll go along with you if
you like. I know just what you ought to have.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose I’ll really have any show for
the team,” said Perry modestly. “But it’ll be pretty
good fun. Say, Fudge, I didn’t know I could run
as fast as I did that first time. It seemed to me I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
was going like the very dickens! It—it’s mighty
interesting, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Fudge, as Perry donned his things.
“You don’t want to try the two-twenty or the hurdles,
do you?”</p>

<p>“I should say not! I’m tuckered out. I’m going
to try the two-twenty some day, though. I don’t
think I’d care about hurdling.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell,” murmured Fudge thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Later, when they had once more surmounted the
fence and were heading toward B Street, Fudge,
who had said little for many minutes, observed:
“I wonder, Perry, if a fellow wouldn’t have more
fun with the Track Team than with the Nine. I’ve
a good mind to go in for it.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?” asked Perry, encouragingly
eager. “What would you try? Running or—or
what?” His gaze unconsciously strayed over his
friend’s rotund figure.</p>

<p>“N-no,” replied Fudge hesitantly. “I don’t think
so. I might go in for the mile, maybe. I don’t
know yet. I’m just thinking of it. I’d have to
study a bit. Perhaps the weights would be my
line. Ever put the shot?” Perry shook his head.
“Neither have I, but I’ll bet I could. All it takes is
practice. Say, wouldn’t it be funny if you and I
both made the team?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>“It would be dandy,” declared Perry. “Do you
suppose there’d be any chance of it?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Fudge cheerfully.</p>

<small>THE SHADOW ON THE CURTAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The two boys parted at Main and B Streets,
Fudge to loiter thoughtfully southward under
the budding maples and Perry to continue
briskly on along the wider thoroughfare to where,
almost at the corner of G Street, a small yellow
house stood in a diminutive yard behind a decaying
picket fence. Over the gate, which had stood open
ever since Perry had grown too old to enjoy swinging
on it, was a square lantern supported on an iron
arch. At night a dim light burned in it, calling the
passer’s attention to the lettering on the front:</p>

<p class="noic smcap">No. 7—Dr. Hull—Office.</p>

<p>Beside the front door a second sign proclaimed
the house to be the abode of Matthew P. Hull, M. D.</p>

<p>Nearby was an old-fashioned bell-pull and, just
below it, a more modern button. Above the latter
were the words “Night Bell.” The house looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
homelike and scrupulously clean, but evidences of
disrepair were abundant. The bases of the four
round pillars supporting the roof of the porch which
ran across the front were rotting, the steps creaked
ominously under Perry’s feet and the faded yellow
paint was blistered and cracked.</p>

<p>Dr. Hull only rented the house, and the owner,
since the retail business district had almost surrounded
it and he expected to soon sell, was extremely
chary of repairs. Perry’s father had lived
there so long that he hated the thought of moving.
He had grown very fond of the place, a fondness
shared to a lesser extent by Mrs. Hull and scarcely
at all by Perry. But Dr. Hull’s motives in remaining
there were not wholly sentimental. He had
slowly and arduously accumulated a fair practice
and, now that the town was over-supplied with physicians,
he feared that a change of location would
lose him his clients. Dr. Hull was not an old man,
but he was forty-odd and rather of the old-style, and
shook his head over the pushing methods of the
newcomers. Perry assured him that it would be a
good thing if he did lose some of his present practice,
since half of it brought him little or no money,
and that in a better location he could secure a better
class of patients. But Perry wasn’t very certain
of this, while his mother, who sighed secretly for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
a home where the plaster didn’t crumble nor the
floors creak, had even less faith in the Doctor’s ability
to begin over again.</p>

<p>Perry glanced through the open door of the tiny
waiting room on the left as he hung up his cap and,
finding it empty and the further door ajar, knew
that his father was out. He went on up the stairs,
which complained at almost every footfall, and stole
noiselessly down the narrow hall to his own room.
His mother’s door was closed and this was the hour
when, on Sundays, she enjoyed what she termed
“forty winks.” Perry’s room was small and lighted
by three narrow windows set close together. While
they admitted light they afforded but little view, for
beyond the shallow back-yard loomed the side wall
of a five-storied brick building which fronted on G
Street. Directly on a level with Perry’s windows
was Curry’s Glove factory, occupying the second
floor of the building. Below was a bakery. Above
were offices; a dentist’s, a lawyer’s, and several
that were empty or changed tenants so frequently
that Perry couldn’t keep track of them. In winter
the light that came through the three windows
was faint and brief, but at other seasons
the sunlight managed somehow to find its way
there. This afternoon a golden ray still lingered
on the table, falling athwart the strapped pile of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
school books and spilling over to the stained green
felt.</p>

<p>Perry seated himself at the table, put an elbow
beside the pile of books and, cupping chin in hand,
gazed thoughtfully down into the yard. There was
a lean and struggling lilac bush against one high
fence and its green leaves were already unfolding.
That, reflected the boy, meant that spring was really
here again at last. It was already nearly the middle
of April. Then came May and June, and then the
end of school. He sighed contentedly at the thought.
Not that he didn’t get as much pleasure out of school
as most fellows, but there comes a time, when buds
are swelling and robins are hopping and breezes
blow warmly, when the idea of spending six hours
of the finest part of the day indoors becomes extremely
distasteful. And that time had arrived.</p>

<p>Perry turned to glance with sudden hostility at
the piled-up books. What good did it do a fellow,
anyway, to learn a lot of Latin and algebra and
physics and—and all the rest of the stuff? If he
only knew what he was going to be when he grew
up it might save a lot of useless trouble! Until a
year ago he had intended to follow in his father’s
footsteps, but of late the profession of medicine had
failed to hold his enthusiasm. It seemed to him
that doctors had to work very hard and long for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
terribly scant returns in the way of either money
or fame. No, he wouldn’t be a doctor. Lawyers
had a far better time of it; so did bankers and—and
almost everyone. Sometimes he thought that
engineering was the profession for him. He would
go to Boston or New York and enter a technical
school and learn civil or mining engineering. Mining
engineers especially had a fine, adventurous life
of it. And he wouldn’t have to spend all the rest
of his life in Clearfield then.</p>

<p>Clearfield was all right, of course; Perry had been
born in it and was loyal to it; but there was a whole
big lot of the world that he’d like to see! He got
up and pulled an atlas from the lower shelf of his
book-case and spread it open. Colorado! Arizona!
Nevada! Those were names for you! And look
at all the territory out there that didn’t have a mark
on it! Prairies and deserts and plateaus! Miles
and miles and miles of them without a town or a
railroad or anything! Gee, it would be great to live
in that part of the world, he told himself. Adventures
would be thick as blueberries out there. Back
here nothing ever happened to a fellow. He wondered
if it would be possible to persuade his father
to move West, to some one of those fascinating
towns with the highly romantic names; like Manzanola
or Cotopaxi or Painted Rock. His thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
were far afield now and, while his gaze was fixed
on the lilac bush below, his eyes saw wonderful
scenes that were very, very foreign to Clearfield.
The sunlight stole away from the windows and the
shadows gathered in the little yard. The room
grew dark.</p>

<p>Just how long Perry would have sat there and
dreamed of far-spread prairies and dawn-flushed
deserts and awesome cañons had not an interruption
occurred, there’s no saying. Probably, though,
until his mother summoned him to the Sunday night
supper. And that, since it was a frugal repast of
cold dishes and awaited the Doctor’s presence, might
not have been announced until seven o’clock. What
did rouse him from his dreaming was the sudden appearance
of a light in one of the third floor windows
of the brick building. It shone for a moment only,
for a hand almost immediately pulled down a shade,
but its rays were bright enough to interrupt the boy’s
visions and bring his thoughts confusedly back.</p>

<p>When you’ve been picturing yourself a cowboy
on the Western plains, a cowboy with a picturesque
broad-brimmed sombrero, leather chaps, a flannel
shirt and a handkerchief knotted about your neck,
it is naturally a bit surprising to suddenly see just
such a vision before your eyes. And that’s what
happened to Perry. No sooner was the shade drawn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
at the opposite window than upon it appeared the
silhouette of as cowboyish a cowboy as ever rode
through sage-brush! Evidently the light was in the
center of the room and the occupant was standing
between light and window, standing so that for a
brief moment his figure was thrown in sharp relief
against the shade, and Perry, staring unbelievingly,
saw the black shadow of a broad felt hat whose
crown was dented to a pyramid shape, a face with
clean-cut features and a generous mustache and,
behind the neck, the knot of a handkerchief! Doubtless
the flannel shirt was there, too, and, perhaps,
the leather cuffs properly decorated with porcupine
quills, but Perry couldn’t be sure of this, for before
he had time to look below the knotted bandana the
silhouette wavered, lengthened oddly and faded from
sight, leaving Perry for an instant doubtful of his
vision!</p>

<p>“Now what do you know about that?” he murmured.
“A regular cowboy, by ginger! What’s he
doing over there, I wonder. And here I was thinking
about him! Anyway, about cowboys! Gee,
that’s certainly funny! I wish I could have seen
if he wore a revolver on his hip! Maybe he’ll come
back.”</p>

<p>But he didn’t show himself again, although Perry
sat on in the darkness of his little room for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
better part of a half-hour, staring eagerly and fascinatedly
at the lighted window across the twilight.
The shade still made a yellowish oblong in the surrounding
gloom of the otherwise blank wall when
his mother’s voice came to him from below summoning
him to supper and he left his vigil unwillingly
and went downstairs.</p>

<p>Dr. Hull had returned and supper was waiting on
the red cloth that always adorned the table on Sunday
nights. Perry was so full of his strange coincidence
that he hardly waited for the Doctor to finish
saying grace before he told about the vision. Rather
to his disappointment, neither his father nor mother
showed much interest, but perhaps that was because
he neglected to tell them that he had been thinking
of cowboys at the time. There was no special
reason why he should have told them other
than that he suspected his mother of a lack
of sympathy on the subject of cowboys and the
Wild West.</p>

<p>“I guess,” said the Doctor, helping to the cold
roast lamb and having quite an exciting chase along
the back of the platter in pursuit of a runaway sprig
of parsley, “I guess your cowboy would have looked
like most anyone else if you’d had a look at him.
Shadows play queer tricks, Perry.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hull was tall and thin, and he stooped quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
perceptibly. Perhaps the stoop came from carrying
his black bag about day after day, for the Doctor
had never attained to the dignity of a carriage.
When he had to have one he hired it from Stewart,
the liveryman. He had a kindly face, but he usually
looked tired and had a disconcerting habit of
dropping off to sleep in the middle of a conversation
or, not infrequently, half-way through a meal.
Perry was not unlike his father as to features. He
had the same rather short and very straight nose
and the same nice mouth, but he had obtained his
brown eyes from his mother. Dr. Hull’s eyes were
pale blue-gray and he had a fashion of keeping them
only a little more than half open, which added to his
appearance of weariness. He always dressed in a
suit of dark clothes which looked black without
actually being black. For years he had had his suits
made for him by the same unstylish little tailor
who dwelt, like a spider in a hole, under the Union
Restaurant on Common Street. Whether the suits,
one of which was made every spring, all came off
the same bolt of cloth, I can’t say, but it’s a fact
that Mrs. Hull had to study long to make out which
was this year’s suit and which last’s. On Sunday
evenings, however, the Doctor donned a faded and
dearly-loved house-jacket of black velveteen with
frayed silk frogs, for on Sunday evenings he kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
no consultation hours and made no calls if he could
possibly help it.</p>

<p>In spite of Perry’s efforts, the cowboy was soon
abandoned as a subject for conversation. The Doctor
was satisfied that Perry had imagined the likeness
and Mrs. Hull couldn’t see why a cowboy hadn’t
as much right in the neighboring building as anyone.
Perry’s explanations failed to convince her of the
incongruity of a cowboy in Clearfield, for she replied
mildly that she quite distinctly remembered
having seen at least a half-dozen cowboys going
along Main Street a year or two before, the time
the circus was in town!</p>

<p>“Maybe,” chuckled the Doctor, “this cowboy got
left behind then!”</p>

<p>Perry refused to accept the explanation, and as
soon as supper was over he hurried upstairs again.
But the light across the back-yard was out and he
returned disappointedly to the sitting-room, convinced
that the mystery would never be explained.
His father had settled himself in the green rep easy
chair, with his feet on a foot-rest, and was smoking
his big meerschaum pipe that had a bowl shaped like
a skull. The Doctor had had that pipe since his
student days, and Perry suspected that, next to his
mother and himself, it was the most prized of the
Doctor’s possessions. The Sunday papers lay spread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
across his knees, but he wasn’t reading, and Perry
seized on the opportunity presented to broach the
matter of going in for the Track Team. There had
been some difficulty in the fall in persuading his
parents to consent to his participation in football,
and he wasn’t sure that they would look any more
kindly on other athletic endeavors. His mother was
still busy in the kitchen, for he could hear the dishes
rattling, and he was glad of it; it was his mother who
looked with most disfavor on such things.</p>

<p>“Dad, I’m going to join the Track Team and try
sprinting,” announced Perry carelessly.</p>

<p>The Doctor brought his thoughts back with a visible
effort.</p>

<p>“Eh?” he asked. “Join what?”</p>

<p>“The Track Team, sir. At school. I think I can
sprint a little and I’d like to try it. Maybe I won’t
be good enough, but Fudge Shaw says I am,
and——”</p>

<p>“Sprinting, eh?” The Doctor removed his pipe
and rubbed the bowl carefully with the purple silk
handkerchief that reposed in an inner pocket of his
house-jacket. “Think you’re strong enough for
that, do you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir! I tried it to-day and didn’t have
any trouble. And the track was awfully wet,
too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“To-day?” The Doctor’s brows went up. “Sunday?”</p>

<p>Perry hastened to explain and was cheered by a
slight smile which hovered under his father’s drooping
mustache when he pictured Fudge trying to
be at both ends of the hundred-yards at once. “You
see, dad, I can’t play baseball well enough, and I’d
like to do something. I ought to anyway, just to
keep in training for football next autumn. I
wouldn’t wonder if I got to be regular quarter-back
next season.”</p>

<p>“Sprinting,” observed the Doctor, tucking his
handkerchief out of sight again, “makes big demands
on the heart muscles, Perry. I’ve no reason for supposing
that your heart isn’t as strong as the average,
but I recall in my college days a case where a boy
over-worked himself in a race, the quarter-mile, I
think it was, and never was good for much afterwards.
He was in my class, and his name was—dear,
dear, now what was it? Well, it doesn’t matter.
Anyway, that’s what you’ll have to guard
against, Perry.”</p>

<p>“But if I began mighty easy, the way you do, and
worked up to it, sir——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say it won’t hurt you. Exercise in
moderation is always beneficial. It’s putting sudden
demands on yourself that does the damage. With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
proper training, going at it slowly, day by day, you
know—well, we’ll see what your mother says.”</p>

<p>Perry frowned and moved impatiently on the
couch. “Yes, sir, but you know mother always finds
objections to my doing things like that. You’d think
I was a regular invalid! Other fellows run and
jump and play football and their folks don’t think
anything of it. But mother——”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Perry! That’ll do, son. Your
mother is naturally anxious about you. You see,
there’s only one of you, and we—well, we don’t want
any harm to come to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Perry, more meekly. “Only I
thought if you’d say it was all right, before she
comes in——”</p>

<p>The Doctor chuckled. “Oh, that’s your little
game, is it? No, no, we’ll talk it over with your
mother. She’s sensible, Perry, and I dare say she
won’t make any objections; that is, if you promise
to be careful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Why, there’s a regular trainer, you
know, and the fellows have to do just as he tells
them to.”</p>

<p>“Who is the trainer?”</p>

<p>“‘Skeet’ Presser, sir. He’s——”</p>

<p>“Skeet?”</p>

<p>“That’s what they call him. He’s small and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
skinny, sort of like a mosquito. I guess that’s why.
I don’t know what his real name is. He used to be
a runner; a jim-dandy, too, they say. He’s trainer
at the Y. M. C. A. I guess he’s considered pretty
good. And very careful, sir.” Perry added that as
a happy afterthought.</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled. “I guess we ought to make
a diplomat out of you, son, instead of a doctor.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll be a doctor, dad.”</p>

<p>“You don’t? I thought you did.”</p>

<p>“I used to, but I—I’ve sort of changed my mind.”</p>

<p>“Diplomats do that, too, I believe. Well, I dare
say you’re right about it. It doesn’t look as if I’d
have much of a practice to hand over to you, anyway.
It’s getting so nowadays about every second
case is a charity case. About all you get is gratitude,
and not always that. Here’s your mother now.
Mother, this boy wants to go in for athletics, he tells
me. Wants to run races and capture silver mugs.
Or maybe they’re pewter. What do you say to it?”</p>

<p>“Gracious, what for?” ejaculated Mrs. Hull.</p>

<p>Perry stated his case again while his mother took
the green tobacco jar from the mantel and placed
it within the Doctor’s reach, plumped up a pillow
on the couch, picked a thread from the worn red
carpet and finally, with a little sigh, seated herself
in the small walnut rocker that was her especial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
property. When Perry had finished, his mother
looked across at the Doctor.</p>

<p>“What does your father think?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think it won’t do him any harm,” was the
reply from the Doctor. “Might be good for him,
in fact. I tell him he must be careful not to attempt
too much at first, that’s all. Running is good exercise
if it isn’t overdone.”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems to me,” observed Mrs. Hull, “that
if he can play football and not get maimed for life,
a little running can’t hurt him. How far would it
be, Perry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, only about from here to the corner and
back.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see much sense in it, but if you
want to do it I haven’t any objection. It doesn’t
seem as if much could happen to you just running
to G Street and back!”</p>

<p>The Doctor chuckled. “It might be good practice
when it comes to running errands, mother. Maybe
he’ll be able to get to the grocery and back the same
afternoon!”</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Perry, “you see, dad, when
you’re running on the track you don’t meet fellows
who want you to stop and play marbles with them!”</p>

<small>THE ODE TO SPRING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">With the advent of that first warm spring-like
weather the High School athletic activities
began in earnest. During March
the baseball candidates had practiced to some extent
indoors and occasionally on the field, but not a great
deal had been accomplished. The “cage” in the basement
of the school building was neither large nor
light, while cold weather, with rain and wet ground,
had made outdoor work far from satisfactory. Of
the Baseball Team, Clearfield had high hopes this
spring. There was a wealth of material left from
the successful Nine of the previous spring, including
two first-class pitchers, while the captain, Warner
Jones, was a good leader as well as a brainy player.
Then too, and in the judgment of the school this
promised undoubted success, the coaching had been
placed in the hands of Dick Lovering. Dick had
proven his ability as a baseball coach the summer
before and had subsequently piloted the football<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
team to victory in the fall, thus winning an admiration
and gratitude almost embarrassing to him.</p>

<p>Dick, who had to swing about on crutches where
other fellows went on two good legs, came out of
school Monday afternoon in company with Lansing
White and crossed over to Linden Street where a
small blue runabout car stood at the curb. Dick was
tall, with dark hair and eyes. Without being especially
handsome, his rather lean face was attractive
and he had a smile that won friends on the instant.
Dick was seventeen and a senior. Lansing, or
Lanny, White was a year younger, and a good deal
of a contrast to his companion. Lanny fairly radiated
health and strength and high spirits. You’re
not to conclude that Dick suggested ill-health or
that he was low-spirited, for that would be far from
the mark. There was possibly no more cheerful boy
in Clearfield than Richard Lovering, in spite of his
infirmity. But Lanny, with his flaxen hair and dark
eyes—a combination as odd as it was attractive—and
his sun-browned skin and his slimly muscular
figure, looked the athlete he was, every inch of him.
Lanny was a “three-letter man” at the High School;
had captained the football team, caught on the nine
and was a sprinter of ability. And, which was no
small attainment, he possessed more friends than
any other fellow in school. Lanny couldn’t help<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
making friends; he appeared to do it without conscious
effort; there had never been on his part any
seeking for popularity.</p>

<p>Lanny cranked the car and seated himself beside
Dick. Fully half the students were journeying toward
the field, either to take part in practice or to
watch it, and the two boys in the runabout answered
many hails until they had distanced the pedestrians.</p>

<p>“This,” said Lanny, as they circumspectly crossed
the car-tracks and turned into Main Street, “is just
the sort of weather the doctor ordered. If it keeps
up we’ll really get started.”</p>

<p>“This is April, though,” replied Dick, “and everyone
knows April!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll have more showers, but once the field
gets dried out decently they don’t matter. I suppose
it’ll be pretty squishy out there to-day. What
we ought to do, Dick, is have the whole field rolled
right now while it’s still soft. It’s awfully rough in
right field, and even the infield isn’t what you’d call
a billiard table.”</p>

<p>“Wish we could, Lanny. But I guess if we get
the base paths fixed up we’ll get all that’s coming
to us this spring. Too bad we haven’t a little money
on hand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know we can’t look to the Athletic Association
for much. I was only wondering if we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
couldn’t get it done somehow ourselves. If we knew
someone who had a steam roller we might borrow
it!”</p>

<p>“The town has a couple,” laughed Dick, “but I’m
afraid they wouldn’t loan them.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Say, that’s an idea, Dick! Who
do you borrow town property from, anyway? The
Mayor?”</p>

<p>“Street Department, I guess. Tell Way to go and
see them, why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Way” was Curtis Wayland, manager of the
baseball team. Lanny smiled. “Joking aside,” he
said, “they might do it, mightn’t they? Don’t they
ever loan things?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but you’d have to have the engineer or
chauffeur or whatever they call him to run it for you,
and that would be a difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, anyone could run a steam roller! You
could, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you see me?” chuckled Dick. “Suppose,
though, I got nabbed for exceeding the speed limit?
I guess, Lanny, if that field gets rolled this spring
it will be done by old-fashioned man-power. We
might borrow a roller somewhere and get a lot
of the fellows out and have them take turns pushing
it.”</p>

<p>“It would take a week of Sundays,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Lanny discouragingly. “You wait. I’m not finished
with that other scheme yet.”</p>

<p>“Borrowing a roller from the town, you mean?
Well, I’ve no objection, but don’t ask me to run it.
I’d be sure to put it through the fence or something;
and goodness knows we need all the fence we’ve
got!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’ll be a miracle if it doesn’t fall down if
anyone hits a ball against it!”</p>

<p>“If it happens in the Springdale game you’ll
hear no complaint from me,” said Dick, adding
hurriedly, “That is, if it’s one of our team who
does it!”</p>

<p>“Ever think of putting a sign on the fence in
center field?” asked Lanny. “‘Hit This Sign and
Get Ten Dollars,’ or something of that sort, you
know. It might increase the team’s average a lot,
Dick.”</p>

<p>“You’re full of schemes to-day, aren’t you? Does
that fence look to you as if it would stand being
hit very often?” They had turned into A Street
and the block-long expanse of sagging ten-foot fence
stretched beside them. “I’ve about concluded that
being presented with an athletic field is like getting
a white elephant in your stocking at Christmas!”</p>

<p>“Gee, this field is two white elephants and a pink
hippopotamus,” replied Lanny as he jumped out in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
front of the players’ gate. Dick turned off the
engine and thoughtfully removed the plug from the
dash coil, thus foiling youngsters with experimental
desires. His crutches were beside him on the running-board,
and, lifting them from the wire clips
that held them there, he deftly swung himself from
the car and passed through the gate. They were the
first ones to arrive, but before they had returned
to the dressing-room under the nearer grandstand
after a pessimistic examination of the playing field,
others had begun to dribble in and a handful of
youths were arranging themselves comfortably on
the seats behind first base. But if the audience
expected anything of a spectacular nature this afternoon
they were disappointed, for the practice was of
the most elementary character.</p>

<p>There was a half-hour at the net with Tom Nostrand
and Tom Haley pitching straight balls to the
batters and then another half-hour of fielding, Bert
Cable, last year’s captain and now a sort of self-appointed
assistant coach, hitting fungoes to outfielders,
and Curtis Wayland, manager of the team,
batting to the infield. The forty or fifty onlookers
in the stands soon lost interest when it was evident
that Coach Lovering had no intention of staging any
sort of a contest, and by ones and twos they took
their departure. Even had they all gone, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
the field would have been far from empty, for there
were nearly as many team candidates as spectators
to-day. More than forty ambitious youths had responded
to the call and it required all the ingenuity
of Dick Lovering and Captain Warner Jones to
give each one a chance. The problem was finally
solved by sending a bunch of tyros into extreme left
field, under charge of Manager Wayland, where
they fielded slow grounders and pop-flies and tested
their throwing arms.</p>

<p>It was while chasing a ball that had got by him
that Way noticed a fluttering sheet of paper near
the cinder track. It had been creased and folded,
but now lay flat open, challenging curiosity. Way
picked it up and glanced at it as he returned to his
place. It held all sorts of scrawls and scribbles, but
the words “William Butler Shaw,” and the letters
“W. B. S.,” variously arranged and entwined, were
frequently repeated. Occupying the upper part of
the sheet were six or seven lines of what, since the
last words rhymed with each other, Way concluded
to be poetry. Since many of the words had been
scored out and superseded by others, and since the
writing was none too legible in any case, Way had
to postpone the reading of the complete poem. He
stuffed it in his pocket, with a chuckle, and went
back to amusing his awkward squad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>Fudge Shaw sat on the bench between Felker and
Grover and awaited his turn in the outfield. Fudge
had played in center some, but he was not quite
Varsity material, so to speak, and his hopes of making
even the second team, which would be formed
presently, from what coach and captain rejected,
were not strong. Still, Fudge “liked to stick around
where things were doing,” as he expressed it, and he
accepted his impending fate with philosophy. Besides,
he had more than half made up his mind to
cast his lot with the Track Team this spring. He
was discussing the gentle art of putting the twelve-pound
shot with Guy Felker when Dick summoned
the outfield trio in and sent Fudge and two others to
take their places. Fudge trotted out to center and
set about his task of pulling down Bert Cable’s flies.
Perhaps his mind was too full of shot-putting to
allow him to give the needed attention to the work
at hand. At all events, he managed to judge his first
ball so badly that it went six feet over his head and
was fielded in by one of Way’s squad. Way was
laughing when Fudge turned toward him after
throwing the ball to the batter.</p>

<p>“A fellow needs a pair of smoked glasses out
here,” called Fudge extenuatingly. This, in view
of the fact that the sun was behind Fudge’s right
shoulder, was a lamentably poor excuse. Possibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
he realized it, for he added: “My eyes have been
awfully weak lately.”</p>

<p>Way, meeting the ball gently with his bat and
causing a wild commotion amongst his fielders, nodded
soberly. “And for many other reasons,” he
called across.</p>

<p>“Eh?” asked Fudge puzzled. But there was
no time for more just then as Bert Cable, observing
his inattention, meanly shot a long low fly into left
field, and Fudge, starting late, had to run half-way
to the fence in order to attempt the catch. Of course
he missed it and then, when he had chased it down,
made matters worse by throwing at least twelve feet
to the left of Cable on the return. The ex-captain
glared contemptuously and shouted some scathing
remark that Fudge didn’t hear. After that, he
got along fairly well, sustaining a bruised finger,
however, as a memento of the day’s activities. When
practice was over he trudged back to the dressing-room
and got into his street clothes. Fortunately,
most of the new fellows had dressed at home and
so it was possible to find room in which to squirm
out of things without collisions. While Fudge was
lacing his shoes he observed that Way and his particular
crony, Will Scott, who played third base,
were unusually hilarious in a far corner of the
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>But Fudge was unsuspicious, and presently he found
himself walking home with the pair.</p>

<p>“Say, this is certainly peachy weather, isn’t it?”
inquired Will as they turned into B Street. “Aren’t
you crazy about spring, Way?”</p>

<p>“Am I? Well, rather! O beauteous spring!”</p>

<p>“So am I. You know it makes the birds sing in
the trees.”</p>

<p>“Sure. And it makes the April breeze to blow.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with you chaps?” asked Fudge
perplexedly. The strange words struck him as dimly
familiar but he didn’t yet connect them with their
source.</p>

<p>“Fudge,” replied Way sadly, “I fear you have
no poetry in your soul. Doesn’t the spring awaken—er—awaken
feelings in your breast? Don’t you
feel the—the appeal of the sunshine and the singing
birds and all that?”</p>

<p>“You’re batty,” said Fudge disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Now for my part,” said Will Scott, “spring art,
I ween, the best of all the seasons.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re saying something,” declared Way
enthusiastically. “It clothes the earth with
green——”</p>

<p>“And for numerous other reasons,” added Will
gravely.</p>

<p>A great light broke on Fudge and his rotund<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
cheeks took on a vivid tinge. “W-w-what you
s-s-silly chumps think you’re up to?” he demanded.
“W-w-where did you g-g-g-get that st-t-t-tuff?”</p>

<p>“Stuff!” exclaimed Way protestingly. “That’s
poetry, Fudge. Gen-oo-ine poetry. Want to hear
it all?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t!”</p>

<p>But Will had already started declaiming and Way
chimed in:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O Beauteous Spring, thou art, I ween,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">The best of all the Seasons,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Because you clothe the Earth with green</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And for numerous other reasons!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“I hope you ch-ch-choke!” groaned Fudge.
“W-w-where’d you get it? Who t-t-told you——”</p>

<p>“Fudge,” replied Way, laughingly, “you shouldn’t
leave your poetic effusions around the landscape if
you don’t want them read.” He pulled the sheet of
paper from his pocket and flaunted it temptingly just
out of reach. “‘You make the birds sing in the
trees——’”</p>

<p>“‘The April breeze to blow,’” continued Will.</p>

<p>“‘The sun to shine——’ What’s the rest of it,
Fudge? Say, it’s corking! It’s got a swing to it
that’s simply immense!”</p>

<p>“And then the sentiment, the poetic feeling!”
elaborated Will. “How do you do it, Fudge?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“Aw, q-q-quit it, fellows, and g-g-g-give me that!”
begged Fudge shame-facedly. “I just did it for
f-f-fun. It d-d-dropped out of my p-p-p——”</p>

<p>But “pocket” was too much for Fudge in his
present state of mind, and he gave up the effort and
tried to get the sheet of paper away. He succeeded
finally, by the time they had reached Lafayette
Street, where their ways parted, and tore it to small
bits and dropped it into someone’s hedge. Way and
Will departed joyfully, and until they were out of
earshot Fudge could hear them declaiming the “Ode
to Spring.” He went home a prey to a deep depression.
He feared that he had by no means heard
the last of the unfortunate poetical effort. And, as
the future proved, his fears were far from groundless.</p>

<small>PERRY REMEMBERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Fudge had an engagement to go to the moving
pictures that evening with Perry Hull.
They put on the new reels on Mondays and
Fudge was a devoted “first-nighter.” Very shortly
after supper was over he picked up a book and carelessly
strolled toward the hall.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, William?” asked his
mother.</p>

<p>“Over to the library,” replied Fudge, making a
strong display of the book in his hand.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t stay late. Haven’t you any studying
to do to-night?”</p>

<p>“No’m, not much. I’ll do it when I come
back.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Mrs. Shaw doubtfully, “it
would be better to do your studying first.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like studying so soon after supper,”
returned Fudge plaintively. “I won’t be gone very
long—I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“Very well, dear. Close the door after you.
It’s downright chilly again to-night.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.” Fudge slipped his cap to the back of
his round head and opened the side door. There he
hesitated. Of course, he was going to the library,
although he didn’t especially want to, for it was
many blocks out of his way, but he meant to make
his visit to that place as short as possible in order
to call for Perry and reach the theater early enough
not to miss a single feature of the evening’s program.
And he was practically telling a lie. Fudge
didn’t like that. He felt decidedly uneasy as he
stood with the door knob in hand. The trouble was
that his mother didn’t look kindly on moving pictures.
She didn’t consider them harmful, but she
did think them a waste of time, and was firmly
convinced that once a month was quite often enough
for Fudge to indulge his passion for that form of
entertainment. Fudge had a severe struggle out
there in the hallway, and I like to think that he would
have eventually decided to make known his principal
destination had not Mrs. Shaw unfortunately
interrupted his cogitations.</p>

<p>“William, have you gone?”</p>

<p>“No’m.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t hold the door open, please. I feel a
draft on my feet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“Yes’m.” Fudge slowly closed the door, with
himself on the outside. The die was cast. He tried
to comfort himself with the assurance that if his
mother hadn’t spoken just when she did he would
have asked permission to go to the “movies.” It
wasn’t his fault. He passed out of the yard whistling
blithely enough, but before he had reached the
corner the whistle had died away. He wished he
had told the whole truth. He was more than half
inclined to go back, but it was getting later every
minute and he had to walk eight blocks to the library
and five back to the theater, and it would take him
several minutes to exchange his book, and Perry
might not be ready——</p>

<p>Fudge was so intent on all this that he passed the
front of the Merrick house, on the corner, without,
as usual, announcing his transit with a certain peculiar
whistle common to him and his friends. He
walked hurriedly, determinedly, trying to keep his
thoughts on the pleasure in store, hoping they’d
have a rattling good melodrama on the bill to-night
and would present less of the “sentimental rot” than
was their custom. But Conscience stalked at Fudge’s
side, and the further he got from home the more
uncomfortable he felt in his mind; and his thoughts
refused to stay placed on the “movies.” But while
he paused in crossing G Street to let one of the big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
yellow cars trundle past him a splendid idea came
to him. He would telephone! There was a booth in
the library, and if he had a nickel—quick examination
of his change showed that he was possessed of
eleven cents beyond the sum required to purchase
admission to the theater. With a load off his mind,
he hurried on faster than ever, ran across the library
grounds with no heed to the “Keep off the
Grass” signs and simply hurtled through the swinging
green doors.</p>

<p>It was the work of only a minute or two to seize
a book from the rack on the counter—it happened
to be a treatise on the Early Italian Painters, but
Fudge didn’t care—and make the exchange. The
assistant librarian looked somewhat surprised at
Fudge’s choice, but secretly hoped that it indicated
a departure from the sensational fiction usually
selected by the boy, and passed the volume across
to him at last with an approving smile. Fudge was
too impatient to see the smile, however. The book
once in his possession, he hurried to the telephone
booth in the outer hall and demanded his
number. Then a perfectly good five-cent piece
dropped forever out of his possession and he heard
his mother’s voice at the other end of the line.</p>

<p>“This is Fudge. Say, Ma, I thought—I’m at the
library, Ma, and I got the book I wanted, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
thought, seeing it’s so early—say, Ma, may I go to
the movies for a little while?”</p>

<p>“You intended to go all the time, didn’t you, William?”
came his mother’s voice.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, but——”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>That was something of a poser. “Well, I meant
to, but—but you said not to keep the door open and—and——”
Fudge’s voice dwindled into silence.</p>

<p>“Why do you tell me now?”</p>

<p>Gee, but she certainly could ask a lot of hard
questions, he reflected. “I thought maybe—oh, I
don’t know, Ma. May I? Just for a little while?
I’m going with Perry—if you say I can.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather you told me in the first place, William,
but telling me now shows that you know you did
wrong. You mustn’t tell lies, William, and when
you said you were going to the library——”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I know!” Fudge was shifting impatiently
from one foot to the other, his eyes fixed on the
library clock, seen through an oval pane in one of
the green baize doors. “I—I’m sorry. Honest, I
am. That’s why I telephoned, Ma.”</p>

<p>“If I let you go to-night you won’t ask to go again
next week?”</p>

<p>“No’m,” replied Fudge dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Very well, then you may go. And you needn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
leave before it’s over, William, because if you don’t
go next week you might as well see all you can this
time.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m! Thanks! Good-by!”</p>

<p>Fudge knew a short cut from Ivy Street to G
Street, and that saved nearly a minute even though
it necessitated climbing a high fence and trespassing
on someone’s premises. He reached Perry’s and,
to his vast relief, found that youth awaiting him at
the gate. Perry was slightly surprised to be hailed
from the direction opposite to that in which he was
looking, but joined Fudge at the corner and, in response
to the latter’s earnest and somewhat breathless
appeal to “Get a move on,” accompanied him
rapidly along the next block. Just as they came into
sight of the brilliantly illumined front of the moving
picture house, eight o’clock began to sound on
the City Hall bell and Fudge broke into a run.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he panted. “We’ll be late!”</p>

<p>They weren’t, though. The orchestra was still
dolefully tuning up as they found seats. The orchestra
consisted principally of a pianist, although
four other musicians were arranged lonesomely on
either side. The two boys were obliged to sit well
over toward the left of the house and when the orchestra
began the overture Fudge’s gaze, attracted
to the performers, stopped interestedly at the pianist.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
“Say, Perry,” he said, “they’ve got a new guy at
the piano. See?”</p>

<p>Perry looked and nodded. Then he took a second
look and frowned puzzledly. “Who is he?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But the other fellow was short
and fat. Say, I hope they have a good melodrama,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, one of those Western plays, eh?” Perry’s
gaze went back to the man at the piano. There was
something about him that awakened recollection.
He was a tall, broad-shouldered man of twenty-six
or -seven, with clear-cut and very good-looking features,
and a luxuriant mustache, as Perry could see
when he turned to smile at one of the violinists. He
played the piano as though he thoroughly enjoyed
it, swaying a little from the hips and sometimes emphasizing
with a sudden swift bend of his head.</p>

<p>“He can play all around the other guy,” said
Fudge in low and admiring whispers. “Wish I could
play a piano like that. I’ll bet he can ‘rag’ like anything!”</p>

<p>At that moment the house darkened and the program
commenced with the customary weekly review.
Fudge sat through some ten minutes of that patiently,
and was only slightly bored when a rustic
comedy was unrolled before him, but when the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
film developed into what he disdainfully called “one
of those mushy things,” gloom began to settle over
his spirits. He squirmed impatiently in his seat and
muttered protestingly. A sharp-faced, elderly lady
next to him audibly requested him to “sit still, for
Mercy’s sake!” Fudge did the best he could and
virtue was rewarded after a while. “Royston of
the Rangers,” announced the film. Fudge sat up,
devoured the cast that followed and, while the orchestra
burst into a jovial two-step, nudged Perry
ecstatically.</p>

<p>“Here’s your Western play,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Perry nodded. Then the first scene swept on the
screen and Fudge was happy. It was a quickly-moving,
breath-taking drama, and the hero, a Texas
Ranger, bore a charmed life if anyone ever did. He
simply had to. If he hadn’t he’d have been dead
before the film had unrolled a hundred feet! Perry
enjoyed that play even more than Fudge, perhaps,
for he was still enthralled by yesterday’s dreams.
There were rangers and cowboys and Mexicans and
a sheriff’s posse and many other picturesque persons,
and “battle, murder and sudden death” was
the order of the day. During a running fight between
galloping rangers and a band of Mexican desperados
Fudge almost squirmed off his chair to
the floor. After that there was a really funny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
“comic” and that, in turn, was followed by another
melodrama which, if not as hair-raising as the first,
brought much satisfaction to Fudge. On the whole,
it was a pretty good show. Fudge acknowledged
it as he and Perry wormed their way out through
the loitering audience at the end of the performance.</p>

<p>They discussed it as they made their way along
to Castle’s Drug Store where Perry was to treat to
sodas. For Fudge at least half the fun was found
in talking the show over afterwards. He was a
severe critic, and if the manager of the theater
could have heard his remarks about the “mushy”
film he might have been moved to exclude such features
thereafter. When they had had their sodas
and had turned back toward Perry’s house, Perry
suddenly stood stock-still on the sidewalk and
ejaculated: “Gee, I know where I saw him!”</p>

<p>“Saw who?” demanded Fudge. “Come on, you
chump.”</p>

<p>“Why, the fellow who played the piano. I’ll bet
you anything he’s the cowboy!”</p>

<p>“You try cold water,” said Fudge soothingly.
“Just wet a towel and put it around your head——”</p>

<p>“No, listen, will you, Fudge? I want to tell you.”
So Perry recounted the odd coincidence of the preceding
evening, ending with: “And I’ll bet you
anything you like that’s the same fellow who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
playing the piano there to-night. I recognized him,
I tell you, only I couldn’t think at first.”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t look like a cowboy to-night,”
replied Fudge dubiously. “Besides, what would he
be doing here? This isn’t any place for cowboys.
I guess you kind of imagined that part of it. Maybe
he had on a felt hat; I don’t say he didn’t; but I
guess you imagined the rest of it. It—it’s psychological,
Perry. You were thinking about cowboys
and such things and then this fellow appeared
at the window and you thought he was dressed like
one.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. I tell you I could see the handkerchief
around his neck and—and everything! I don’t
say he really is a cowboy, but I know mighty well
he was dressed like one. And I know he’s the fellow
we saw playing the piano.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks, cowboys don’t play pianos, Perry.
Besides, what does it matter anyway?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, I suppose, only—only it’s sort of funny.
I’d like to know why he was got up like a cowboy.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask him? Tell you what we’ll
do, Perry, we’ll go up there to-morrow after the
show’s over and lay in wait for him.”</p>

<p>“Up to his room? I wonder if he has an office.
Maybe he gives lessons, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“What sort of lessons?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“Piano lessons. Why would he have an office?”</p>

<p>“Search me. But we’ll find out. We’ll put
‘Young Sleuth’ on his trail. Maybe there’s a mystery
about him. I’ll drop around after practice to-morrow
and we’ll trail him down. Say, what about
the Track Team? Thought you were going to join.”</p>

<p>“I was. Only—oh, I got to thinking maybe I
couldn’t run very fast, after all.”</p>

<p>“Piffle! We’ll have another trial, then. I’ll get
Gordon to hold the watch at the start and I’ll time
you at the finish. What do you say? Want to try
it to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“No, I’d feel like a fool,” muttered Perry. “Maybe
I’ll register to-morrow, anyway. I dare say it
won’t do any harm even if I find I can’t sprint much.
What about you and putting the shot?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try for it, I guess. Baseball’s no
good for me. They won’t even give me a place on
the Second, I suppose. Guess I’ll talk to Felker
about it to-morrow. You’re silly if you don’t have
a try at it, Perry. You’ve got the making of a
dandy sprinter; you mark my words!”</p>

<p>“If you’ll register for the team, I will,” said
Perry.</p>

<p>“All right! It’s a bargain!”</p>

<p class="cap">“Well?” asked Lanny.</p>

<p>Curtis Wayland shook his head and
smiled. “He thought I was fooling at
first. Then he thought I was crazy. After that he
just pitied me for not having any sense.”</p>

<p>“I’ve pitied you all my life for that,” laughed
Lanny. “But what did he say?”</p>

<p>“Said in order for him to let us have the use of
town property he’d have to introduce a bill or something
in the Council and have it passed and signed
by the Mayor and sworn to by the Attorney and
sealed by the Sealer and—and——”</p>

<p>“And stamped by the stamper?” suggested Dick
Lovering helpfully.</p>

<p>“Cut out the comedy stuff,” said Lanny. “He
just won’t do it, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I gathered,” Way assented dryly.
“And if, in my official capacity of——”</p>

<p>“Or incapacity,” interpolated Lanny sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Way scowled fearsomely. “If in my capacity of
manager of this team,” he resumed with dignity,
“I’m required to go on any more idiotic errands like
that I’m going to resign. I may be crazy and
foolish, but I hate to have folks mention it.”</p>

<p>“We’re all touchy on our weak points,” said
Lanny kindly. “Well, I suppose you did the best
you could, Way, but I’m blessed if I see how it
would hurt them to let us use their old road roller.”</p>

<p>“He also dropped some careless remark about the
expense of running it,” observed Way, “from which
I gathered that, even if he did let us take it, he
meant to sock us about fifteen dollars a day!”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” Dick asked.</p>

<p>“He’s Chairman or something of the Street Department.”</p>

<p>“Superintendent of Streets,” corrected Way. “I
saw it on the door.”</p>

<p>“I mean,” explained Dick, “what’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Burns. He’s Ned Burns’ father.”</p>

<p>“Uncle,” corrected Way.</p>

<p>“Could Burns have done anything with him, do
you suppose?” Dick asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. The man is deficient in public
spirit and lacking in—in charitable impulse, or
something.” Lanny frowned intently at Way until
the latter said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>“Out with it! What’s on your mind?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. Only—well, that field certainly
needs a good rolling.”</p>

<p>“It certainly does,” assented Way. “But if you’re
hinting for me to go back and talk to that man
again——”</p>

<p>“I’m not. The time for asking has passed. We
gave them a chance to be nice about it and they
wouldn’t. Now it’s up to us.”</p>

<p>“Right-o, old son! What are we going to do
about it?”</p>

<p>Lanny smiled mysteriously. “You just hold your
horses and see,” he replied. “I guess the crowd’s
here, Dick. Shall we start things up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s get at it. Hello, Fudge!”</p>

<p>“Hello, fellers! Say, Dick, I’m quitting.”</p>

<p>“Quitting? Oh, baseball, you mean. What’s the
trouble?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not good enough and there’s no use my
hanging around, I guess. I’m going out for the
Track Team to-morrow. I thought I’d let you
know.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Well, I’m sorry, Fudge, but you’re
right about it. You aren’t quite ready for the team
yet. Maybe next year——”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought. Lanny’ll be gone then
and maybe I’ll catch for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“That’s nice of you,” laughed Lanny. “I was
worried about what was going to happen after I’d
left. Meanwhile, though, Fudge, what particular
stunt are you going to do on the Track Team?”</p>

<p>“Weights, I guess. Perry Hull’s going out for
the team and he dared me to. Think I could put the
shot, Dick?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know, Fudge. It wouldn’t take
you long to find out, though. You’re pretty strong,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” replied Fudge quite modestly.
“Anyway, Felker’s yelling for fellows to join and I
thought there wouldn’t be any harm in trying.”</p>

<p>“‘And for many other reasons,’” murmured
Way. The others smiled, and Fudge, with an embarrassed
and reproachful glance, hurried away to
where Perry was awaiting him in the stand.</p>

<p>“Fellows who read other fellows’ things that
aren’t meant for them to read are pretty low-down,
I think,” he ruminated. “And I’ll tell him so, too,
if he doesn’t let up.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you love spring?” asked Perry as Fudge
joined him. “It makes——”</p>

<p>Fudge turned upon him belligerently. “Here,
don’t you start that too!” he exclaimed warmly.</p>

<p>“Start what?” gasped Perry. “I only said——”</p>

<p>“I heard what you said! Cut it out!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” asked Perry.
“Can’t I say that I like spring if I want to?”</p>

<p>“And what else were you going to say?” demanded
Fudge sternly.</p>

<p>“That it makes you feel nice and lazy,” replied
the other in hurt tones.</p>

<p>“Oh! Nothing about—about the birds singing or
the April breeze?”</p>

<p>Perry viewed his friend in genuine alarm. “Honest,
Fudge, I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Aren’t you well?”</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t heard it.” Fudge sighed.
“Sorry I bit your head off.”</p>

<p>“Heard what?” asked Perry in pardonable curiosity.</p>

<p>Fudge hesitated and tried to retreat, but Perry
insisted on being informed, and finally Fudge told
about the “Ode to Spring” and the fun the fellows
were having with him. “I get it on all sides,” he
said mournfully. “Tappen passed me a note in
Latin class this morning; wanted to know what the
other reasons were. Half the fellows in school are
on to it and I don’t hear anything else. I’m sick
of it!”</p>

<p>Perry’s eyes twinkled, but he expressed proper
sympathy, and Fudge finally consented to forget
his grievance and lend a critical eye to the doings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of the baseball candidates. They didn’t remain until
practice was over, however, for, in his capacity of
“Young Sleuth,” Fudge was determined to unravel
the mystery of the cowboy-pianist, as he called the
subject for investigation. The afternoon performance
at the moving picture theater was over about
half-past four or quarter to five, and a few minutes
after four the two boys left the field and went back
to town. Fudge explained the method of operation
on the way.</p>

<p>“We’ll wait outside the theater,” he said. “I’ll
be looking in a window and you can be on the other
side of the street. He mustn’t see us, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Perry.</p>

<p>“Because he might suspect.”</p>

<p>“Suspect what?”</p>

<p>“Why, that we were on his track,” explained
Fudge a trifle impatiently. “You don’t suppose detectives
let the folks they are shadowing know it,
do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what harm it would do if he saw us.
There isn’t anything for him to get excited about,
is there?”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell. I’ve been thinking a lot about
this chap, Perry, and the more I—the more I study
the case the less I like it.” Fudge frowned intensely.
“There’s something mighty suspicious about him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
I think. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’d done something.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, done something?”</p>

<p>“Why, committed some crime. Maybe he’s sort
of hiding out here. No one would think of looking
for him in a movie theater, would they?”</p>

<p>“Maybe not, but if they went to the theater they’d
be pretty certain to see him, wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Huh! He’s probably disguised. I’ll bet that
mustache of his is a fake one.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t look so,” Perry objected. “What
sort of—of crime do you suppose he committed,
Fudge?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s pretty slick-looking. I wouldn’t be
surprised if he turned out to be a safe-breaker.
Maybe he’s looking for a chance to crack a safe here
in Clearfield; sort of studying the lay of the land,
you know, and seeing where there’s a good chance
to get a lot of money. We might go over to the
police station, Perry, and see if there’s a description
of him there. I’ll bet you he’s wanted somewhere
for something all right!”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out, Fudge! The fellow’s a dandy-looking
chap. And even if he had done something and
I knew it, I wouldn’t go and tell on him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t say I would, did I? B-b-but
there’s no harm in finding out, is there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>Whether Fudge’s watch was slow or whether,
absorbed in their conversation, they consumed more
time than they realized on the way, the City Hall
clock proclaimed twenty-two minutes to five when
they reached the Common and, to Fudge’s intense
disgust, the theater was out. The ticket-seller had
departed from his glass hutch between the two doors
and the latter were closed. Fudge scowled his displeasure.</p>

<p>“He’s made his getaway,” he said, “but he can’t
escape us long. The Hand of the Law——” He
paused, his attention attracted by one of the colorful
posters adorning the entrance. “Say, Perry, that’s
where the Mexican tries to throw her off the cliff.
Remember? I’d like to see that again. It’s a
corker! Gee, why didn’t we think to come here this
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather wait until Thursday and see some new
ones,” replied Perry. “Come over to the house for
a while, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going on with this?” asked Fudge
surprisedly.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s gone, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t keep us from having a look at his
hiding place, does it? We’ll go around there and
reconnoiter. Come on.”</p>

<p>But Perry held back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want him to think we were snooping
on him, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“He won’t know. We’ll just track him to his lair
but we won’t let on we’re after him. It’s a good
idea to know where to find him in case we want him.
And we’d ought to find out whether there’s more
than one way for him to get in and out.”</p>

<p>“I know there is. There’s a front door and a
back. The back door lets out into that little alley
next to Cosgrove’s store on Common Street.”</p>

<p>“Cosgrove’s? Ha!” Fudge stopped abruptly and
tried to look as much like his favorite hero, “Young
Sleuth,” as possible. “That’s it, then!”</p>

<p>“What’s it?” asked Perry impatiently.</p>

<p>“It’s Cosgrove’s he’s after. Don’t you see?”
Cosgrove’s was the principal jewelry store in Clearfield.
“That’s why he rented a room in that block,
Perry. All he’s got to do is to go out the back way
to the alley and there he is!”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy,” laughed Perry. “You don’t know
that the man’s a—a criminal, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, it looks mighty like it,” asserted Fudge,
shaking his head in a very satisfied way. “Everything
points to it. We’ll have a look at the alley
first, I guess.”</p>

<p>The entrance was only a half-block distant and
Perry followed his enthusiastic friend up its narrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
length until it stopped at a board fence beyond
which was the back yard of the next house to the
Hulls’. On the way Fudge paid much attention
to the three barred windows of Cosgrove’s store.</p>

<p>“See if you see signs of a file,” he whispered to
Perry. “That’s what he’d probably do; come down
here at night and file the bars away. Maybe we’d
better go into the store and see where the safe is
located.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t stop tugging at those bars we’ll get
pinched,” objected Perry. He was losing his interest
in the affair and had begun to think Fudge’s
sleuthing rather tiresome. Besides, it was getting
sort of dark in the little alley and he had already
collided painfully with an ash-barrel. He was relieved
when Fudge finally satisfied himself that
so far, at least, the bars of the jewelry store
windows had not been tampered with. Fudge was
evidently disappointed and not a little surprised. He
did a good deal of muttering as he went on to the
end of the alley. There he stared across the fence.</p>

<p>“Whose house is that?” he asked in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>“Judge Folwell’s. No one lives in it now,
though.”</p>

<p>“Hm,” said Fudge. “Your house is over there,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. That’s the roof.”</p>

<p>“Has your father got a safe?”</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t. For the love of mud, Fudge,
come on home.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute.” Fudge turned to the back of
the brick block. “What’s on the first floor here?”</p>

<p>“Ginter’s Bakery.”</p>

<p>“Then this door opens into that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose so. What difference
does it make?”</p>

<p>“It makes a lot of difference,” replied Fudge with
much dignity. “If it does, he’d have to pass through
the bakery to get out this way, wouldn’t he? And
someone would be likely to see him. What we’ve
got to find out is whether it does or doesn’t.” Fudge
walked up the two stone steps and tried the latch.
The door opened easily. Inside was silence and
darkness. Fudge hesitated. “Maybe,” he murmured,
“we’d better try the front way first.”</p>

<p>They did, Perry, for one, retracing his steps
through the darkening alley with relief. At the main
entrance of the building on G Street they climbed
two flights of stairs, Fudge cautioning his companion
against making too much noise, and, with
assumed carelessness, loitered down the hall to the
last door on the right. There were some five or
six offices on each side and several of them appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
to be unoccupied at present. Nor was there anything
about the door they sought to suggest that the room
behind it was the refuge of a desperate criminal or,
for that matter, anyone else. The door was closed
and bore no sign. The two boys halted at a discreet
distance and studied it.</p>

<p>“Wonder if he’s in there now,” whispered Fudge.</p>

<p>“Probably,” replied Perry uneasily. The hall was
silent and shadows lurked in the corners. From the
floor below came the faint ticking of a typewriter,
but that was all the sound that reached them until an
automobile horn screeched outside. Perry jumped
nervously.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he whispered. “Let’s beat it. He
might come out and——”</p>

<p>At that moment footsteps sounded on the lower
flight. Perry tugged at Fudge’s arm. “Come on,
can’t you?” he urged. But Fudge was listening
intently to the approaching steps. The person, whoever
he was, tramped along the hall below and began
the ascent of the next flight. Perry looked about
for concealment. A few yards away a half-open
door showed an empty and dusty interior. Perry
slid through and Fudge followed, closing the door
softly all but a few inches. The footsteps reached
the top of the stairs and approached along the corridor,
passed and kept on toward the back of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
building. Cautiously the two boys peered out. It
was the cowboy-pianist. He paused at the last portal,
produced a key, inserted it in the lock and opened
the door. And as he passed from sight he raised a
hand and removed the luxuriant brown mustache
from his upper lip!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>FUDGE REVOLTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The boys crept quietly down the stairs and
out into the street. It was not until they had
turned the corner that Fudge broke the
silence.</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” he murmured
awedly.</p>

<p>“Looks as though you were right,” returned
Perry admiringly. “He was disguised, all right.”</p>

<p>“I—I’ve got to think this over,” said Fudge. He
was plainly bewildered. They paused at Perry’s
gate and he declined an invitation to enter, with
a shake of his head. “I guess,” he muttered,
“there’s more in this than I thought. You saw
him take it off, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course!”</p>

<p>Fudge sighed relievedly. Perhaps he had doubted
the evidences of his senses. “Well, I’ll think
it over, and to-morrow——”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Perry interestedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll see,” was Fudge’s cryptic and unsatisfactory
reply. “So long. And not a word of this to
a living soul, Perry!”</p>

<p>“All right. But, say, Fudge”—Perry dropped his
voice—“do you really think he’s a—a criminal?”</p>

<p>“What else can he be? Folks don’t wear false
mustaches for nothing, do they?”</p>

<p>“N-no, but he might be doing it for—for a
sort of joke,” returned the other lamely.</p>

<p>Fudge sniffed. “Joke! I’ll bet the joke will
be on him before I’m—before we’re done with
him! You leave it to me. Night!”</p>

<p>Fudge strode off in the twilight. There was
something very stealthy and even somber in his
departure. Perry, watching a bit admiringly, saw
the careful manner in which the amateur detective
discounted surprise by keeping close to the fence
and peering cautiously at each tree as he approached
it. At last Fudge melted mysteriously into the distant
shadows down the street, and Perry, somewhat
thrilled with the afternoon’s adventure, hurried upstairs
and glanced toward the window in the brick
building. There was a light behind the lowered
shade, but, although he kept watch for nearly a
half-hour, nothing came into view.</p>

<p>He wondered what was going on behind that
window, and imagined all sorts of deliciously exciting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
things. Perhaps the mysterious cowboy pianist
was studying a plan of Cosgrove’s jewelry store,
or perhaps he was bending over a fascinating assortment
of jimmies and files and—yes, there’d be
an acetylene torch for burning a hole in the steel
safe, and there’d be dynamite or nitro-glycerine
or something equally useful to a safe-breaker! If
only he might somehow get a momentary peek
into that room over there! He was so full of
his interesting neighbor that he ate almost no supper
and incurred the anxious displeasure of his
mother.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you feeling well, Perry?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No’m—I mean, yes’m!”</p>

<p>“I think, Father, you’d better have a look at him
after supper. His face looks feverish to me.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right, honest, Ma! I—I just ain’t hungry.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say ‘ain’t,’ Perry. Have you been eating
this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“No’m.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry about him,” said the Doctor.
“These first spring days are likely to interfere with
one’s appetite. Have you started that sprinting yet?
Been doing too much running to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, we don’t start until to-morrow. Dad,
did you ever see a burglar?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose so. I don’t recollect. Have you
seen one around?”</p>

<p>Perry almost changed color. “No, sir—that is—I
just wondered whether they wore false mustaches.”</p>

<p>“Now, Perry Hull, what sort of nonsense
have you been reading?” inquired his mother.
“Some of the books you get out of the library
aren’t fit for any boy; all about fighting and Indians
and—and now it’s burglars, I dare say! I
don’t see when you have time for reading, anyway,
with all those lessons to study. Your report card
last month wasn’t anything to boast of, either.”</p>

<p>“It was all right except math.,” defended Perry.
“Gee, if you think my card was punk, you ought
to see some of them!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything about ‘punk,’” retorted
Mrs. Hull with dignity. “And I’d like to know
where you get all the horrid words you use lately.
I dare say it’s that Shaw boy. He looks rather
common, I think.”</p>

<p>“There, there, Mother, don’t scold him any more,”
said the Doctor soothingly. “Slang’s harmless
enough. Have a slice of lamb, son?”</p>

<p>Perry dutifully passed his plate and consumed
the lamb, not because he had any appetite for it
but in order to allay his mother’s suspicions of illness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
There were some especially nasty bottles in
the Doctor’s office and Perry had long ago vowed
never to be ill again! After supper he excused
himself early and retired to his room to study.
Mrs. Hull smiled commendingly. It was evident
to her that her remarks had borne fruit. But
Perry didn’t get very much studying done, because
he spent much of the evening peeking cautiously
around the corner of his window shade. Of course
he realized that the safe-breaker would be at the
theater in his assumed rôle of pianist, but it had
occurred to Perry that possibly he had an accomplice.
But the opposite window remained dark all
the evening, or at least until after Perry, ready
for bed, had sent a final look across the starlit
gloom. What happened subsequently he didn’t
know, but he dreamed the wildest, most extravagant
dreams in which he was at one moment participating
in furious deeds of crime and the next,
aligned on the side of Justice, was heroically pursuing
a whole horde of criminals across the roofs
of the city. That the criminals were under the
able and even brilliant leadership of Fudge Shaw
did not strike him as the least bit incongruous—until
the next morning!</p>

<p>When he finally tumbled out of bed, after reviewing
his dreams, or as much as he could recall of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
them, he went first to the window and looked across
the back yard. His heart leaped into his throat
at what he saw. The last window on the third floor
of the brick building was wide-open and there, in
plain view of all the world, sat the safe-breaker!
A small table was pulled in front of the casement
and the safe-breaker was seated at it. On the
table were a cup and saucer, some dishes and a
newspaper. Perry gazed fascinatedly. The safe-breaker
alternately read the paper and ate his
breakfast. Perry couldn’t be quite certain, but it
appeared that the breakfast consisted of sausage
and rolls and coffee. Whatever it was, the man
ate with evident enjoyment, slowly, perusing the
morning news between mouthfuls. There was no
mustache to-day. Instead, the safe-breaker’s face
was clean-shaven and undeniably good-looking in
a rugged way. He had a rather large nose and a
generous mouth and lean cheeks and a very determined-looking
chin. His hair was brown, with
some glints of red in it where the sunlight touched
it. He was attired in quite ordinary clothes, so far
as the observer could see, but wore no coat; perhaps
because the morning was delightfully warm
and the sunlight shone in at his window. Fortunately
for Perry, the man never once glanced
his way. If he had he might easily have seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
a boy in blue pajamas staring fascinatedly across at
him with very wide, round eyes. In which case
doubtless he would have suspected that he was
under surveillance!</p>

<p>Perry was still looking when his mother’s voice
summoned him to action. Regretfully he withdrew
his gaze and hurried off to the bathroom.
When he returned the safe-breaker was still there,
but he had finished his breakfast and was smoking
a short pipe, still busy with the paper, and so
Perry was obliged to leave him, and when he
had finished his own repast and raced upstairs
again the opposite window was empty. Perry set
off to school fairly weighted down with the startling
news he had to tell Fudge Shaw, and hoping
beyond everything that he would be fortunate
enough to meet with that youth before the bell
rang. He wasn’t, however, and not until the noon
hour did he find a chance to unburden himself.
Then, while he and Fudge, together with some two
hundred other boys—not to mention an even larger
number of girls—sat on the coping around the
school grounds and ate their luncheons, he eagerly,
almost breathlessly, recounted the story of what he
had seen.</p>

<p>Fudge was plainly impressed, and he asked any
number of searching and seemingly purposeless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
questions, but in the end he appeared a little disappointed.
“It doesn’t seem,” he said, “that he’d
show himself like that if he’s what we think he
is. Unless, of course, he’s doing it for a bluff;
to avert suspicion, you know.”</p>

<p>Perry nodded.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look much like a criminal,” he said
doubtfully. “He’s sort of nice-looking, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Lots of the best of ’em are,” was the sententious
reply. “Look at—oh, lots of ’em! Remember the
crook in that movie play last month, the fellow
who forged things?”</p>

<p>“Jim the Penman? Yes, but he was only an
actor, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Makes no difference. Those plays are true to
life, Perry. That’s why they got that good-looking
chap to act that part, don’t you see? That’s one
of the most suspicious things about this fellow.
He’s too good-looking, too innocent, don’t you see?
He’s probably an awfully clever cracksman, Perry.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” replied the other hopefully. “What
do you suppose he was so interested in the paper
for?”</p>

<p>Fudge frowned thoughtfully as he conveyed the
last morsel of a generous sandwich to his mouth.
“You can’t tell. Maybe he was looking to see if
the police were on his track. Or maybe——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>But the bell cut short further speculation and,
agreeing to meet after school, they went back to
the drudgery of learning. Perry had not had time
to ask Fudge what plan of procedure the latter
had decided on, a fact which interfered sadly with
his work during the final session. As it developed
later, however, Fudge had not decided on the best
manner in which to continue the relentless pursuit
of the criminal. As they made their way to
the athletic field Fudge talked a great deal on the
subject but, to Perry’s disappointment, didn’t seem
to arrive anywhere. It would be necessary, thought
Fudge, to do a good deal of watching before they
could obtain enough evidence in the case. What
they ought to do, he declared, was to shadow the
safe-breaker and never let him out of their sight.
But this, as Perry pointed out, was rather impractical,
considering that they had to spend most of
the day in school. Whereupon Fudge reminded
him that Saturday was coming.</p>

<p>“We’ll have the whole day then. The only thing
I’m afraid of is that he will pull it off before that
and make his getaway. And, of course, if we want
to get the reward we’ve got to collar him before
that.”</p>

<p>“Reward?” echoed Perry. “What reward?”</p>

<p>“Why, the reward for his apprehension.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“How do you know there’s any reward?”</p>

<p>“I don’t <em>know</em> it, but it stands to reason, doesn’t
it, that there is one? If that fellow’s wanted somewhere
there’s sure to be a reward out for him, and
a description and all. I wish I knew how much it
is!”</p>

<p>“How much do you suppose?” asked Perry.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe five hundred dollars, maybe a thousand.
It depends, you see, on how much swag he
got away with on his last job. Maybe he killed
someone. You can’t tell. Burglars are desperate
folks when they’re interrupted.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he’d kill anyone,” said Perry.
“He doesn’t look that sort.”</p>

<p>Fudge, though, shook his head unconvincedly.
“You can’t tell,” he said. “Anyway, if he has, the
reward’s bound to be bigger. You keep your eyes
peeled, Perry, and watch that window closely. I
wouldn’t be surprised if you discovered something
mighty important in the next day or two. He must
be getting pretty nearly ready to do something.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think, then, he has an accomplice?”
asked Perry.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. He sort of looks like a man who’d
work on his own hook. It’s lots safer, you see,
and he has a pretty wise face.”</p>

<p>There, for the time being, the subject had to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
abandoned, for they had reached the field and confidential
conversation was no longer possible.</p>

<p>Not only the baseball candidates were out to-day
but some forty-odd aspirants for positions on the
Track Team. These were clustered at the further
side of the inclosure where the coach and trainer,
“Skeet” Presser, were, rather dubiously it seemed,
looking them over. Guy Felker, eighteen years of
age and a senior, was captain this year, and Arthur
Beaton was manager. Beaton was checking off the
candidates from a list he held and Captain Felker
was inquiring of no one in particular “where the
rest of them were.” Sixty-four names had gone
down on the notice-board in the school corridor and
only forty-four had shown up. “Skeet” explained
the absence of a number of the delinquents by reminding
Guy that fellows couldn’t practice baseball
and report for track work both. Guy consented
to become slightly mollified, and, Manager
Beaton having completed his checking, the coach
and trainer took charge.</p>

<p>“Skeet” was a slight, wiry man of some thirty
years, with a homely, good-natured countenance
and a pair of very sharp and shrewd black eyes.
He had been in his time a professional one- and
two-miler of prominence, but of late years had made
a business of training. He was regularly employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
by the Clearfield Young Men’s Christian Association,
but his duties there did not occupy all his
time and for three seasons he had coached and
trained the High School athletes, and with a fair
measure of success, since during his régime Clearfield
had once won overwhelmingly from her rival,
Springdale, had once been beaten decisively and had
once lost the meeting by a bare three points. This
year, if Guy Felker could have his way, the purple
of Clearfield was to wave in gorgeous triumph over
the blue of Springdale.</p>

<p>The trouble was, however, that after the last
defeat by her rival Clearfield High School had
rather lost enthusiasm for track and field sports.
The pendulum swung far over toward baseball,
and this spring it had been more than usually difficult
to persuade fellows to come out for the
Track Team. Felker had posted notice after notice
calling for volunteers before his insistence had
stirred up any response. Of course there was a
nucleus in the hold-overs from last season, but
they were not many and new material was badly
needed if the Purple was to make a real showing
against the Blue. Within the last week the list on
the notice-board had grown encouragingly in length,
though, and with a half-hundred candidates to
choose from it would seem that coach and captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
should have been encouraged. Unfortunately,
though, a good half of the aspirants were youngsters
whose chances of making good were decidedly
slim, and “Skeet” and Guy Felker both realized
that if, after the final weeding out, they had twenty-five
fellows to build the team with they might consider
themselves extremely fortunate.</p>

<p>At least half of the candidates who reported this
afternoon were in street togs. Those who were
not were taken by Guy for a slow run out into the
country and the others were dismissed with instructions
to report to-morrow dressed for work. Of
the former were Fudge and Perry, and it was their
fortune to amble over the better part of two miles
at the tail-end of a strung-out procession of runners.
Perry was in the rear because Fudge was.
Fudge was there because running was not a strong
point with him. If it hadn’t been for the occasional
rests allowed by the captain, Fudge would have
dropped out, discouraged and winded, long before
they got back to the field. As it was, however, he
managed to remain within sight of the leaders.
Once when, having trotted up a hill, he subsided on
a convenient ledge to regain his breath, he voiced
a protest.</p>

<p>“Gee,” panted Fudge, “I don’t see any good in
running all over the landscape like this when you’re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
going to be a shot-putter! If I’d known they were
going to spring this on me I wouldn’t have signed
for the team!”</p>

<p>“I guess maybe it’s good for you,” replied Perry,
“whether you’re going to throw weights or run or
jump. Hadn’t we better start along again? The
others are nearly a quarter of a mile away now.”</p>

<p>Fudge lifted a dejected head and viewed the situation.
His face brightened. “They’re going
around the hill, Perry,” he said. “That’s all right.
We’ll just trot down this side and pick ’em up
again at the road.”</p>

<p>Perry wanted to demur at that, but Fudge’s discomfort
was so real that he had to sympathize, and
so they cut off to the right and reached the bottom
of the hill shortly after the first runners had
passed. There were many knowing grins as the
two boys trotted out from the fringe of trees.</p>

<p>“Did you lose your way?” asked one chap solicitously.</p>

<p>“No, I lost my breath,” replied Fudge. “Had
to stop and look for it.”</p>

<p>“‘And for numerous other reasons,’” remarked
a voice behind him.</p>

<p>Fudge glanced back with a scowl, but every face
in sight was guileless and innocent.</p>

<p>Later, when they were making their way home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
from the field, Fudge pulled his feet after him
wearily and groaned every few yards.</p>

<p>“I’ll be as stiff as a crutch to-morrow,” he sighed
pessimistically. “F-f-for two cents I’d tell Guy to
find someone else to put his old shot for him. I
d-d-didn’t agree to be a b-b-b-blooming slave!”</p>

<p>Still, he managed to drag himself around to
Perry’s after supper and until it was time for the
theater to open they watched the window across the
yard. But they saw nothing, not even a light.
Fudge feared that their quarry had flown and accused
Perry of scaring him away. “He probably
saw you watching him and has skipped out. Bet
we’ll never see him again!”</p>

<p>“But I’m quite sure he didn’t see me,” expostulated
the other. “He didn’t look up once.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you think. He must have seen you.
Well, there goes five hundred dollars!”</p>

<p>“You don’t even know there was any reward for
him, so what’s the good of grouching about it?”</p>

<p>But Fudge refused to cheer up and presently took
his departure gloomily. It is very easy to be a
pessimist when one is weary, and Fudge was very
weary indeed!</p>

<small>LANNY STUDIES STEAM ENGINEERING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They were putting down a two-block stretch
of new macadam on the Lafayette Street
extension. A bed of cracked stone, freshly
sprinkled, was receiving the weighty attention of
the town’s biggest steam roller as Lanny White
strolled around the corner. <em>Chug-chug-chug!
Scrunch-scrunch-scrunch!</em> Lanny paused, hands in
pockets, and looked on. Back and forth went
the roller, the engineer skillfully edging it toward
the center of the road at the end of each trip.
Further down the street, where the workmen were
tearing up the old dirt surface, a second and much
smaller roller stood idle, its boiler simmering and
purring. Lanny smiled.</p>

<p>“Me for the little one,” he muttered, as he walked
toward the smaller roller. The engineer was a
huge, good-natured looking Irishman with a bristling
red mustache, so large that he quite dwarfed the
machine. He had a bunch of dirty cotton waste in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
his hand and, apparently for the want of something
better to do, was rubbing it here and there about
the engine. He looked up as Lanny came to a
stop alongside, met Lanny’s smile and smiled back.
Then he absent-mindedly mopped his face with the
bunch of waste, without, however, appreciable effect,
and leaned against the roller.</p>

<p>“Gettin’ warm,” he volunteered.</p>

<p>Lanny nodded, casting his eyes interestedly over
the engine.</p>

<p>“I should think that would be a pretty warm job
in hot weather,” he observed conversationally.</p>

<p>“’Tis so. Put eighty or ninety pounds o’ shtame
in her an’ she throws out the hate somethin’ fierce.”</p>

<p>“She’s smaller than the other one, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yep. We use this one for the sidewalk work
gin’rally. But she’s good for tearin’ up when she’s
the spikes in her.”</p>

<p>“Spikes?” asked Lanny.</p>

<p>“Thim things.” The man picked up a steel spike
some eight inches long from the floor and showed
Lanny how it was fixed in one of the numerous
holes bored in the surface of the roller. After that
Lanny’s curiosity led to all sorts of questions. At
the engineer’s invitation he mounted the platform
and, under instruction, moved the roller backwards
and forwards and altered its course by the steering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
wheel and peered into the glowing furnace under
the boiler and listened to an exposition on the subject
of getting up steam and the purposes of the
steam and water gauges. The engineer was a willing
teacher and Lanny an apt pupil, and they both
enjoyed themselves.</p>

<p>“And what do you do with it at night?” asked
Lanny innocently. “Do you leave it here and put
the fire out?”</p>

<p>“Lave it here, yes, but I don’t put the fire out,
lad. I just bank it down, d’you see, an’ thin in the
mornin’ I just rake her out a bit and throw some
more coal in and there she is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. And how much steam does she have
to have to work on?”</p>

<p>“Depends. Sixty pounds’ll carry her along on a
level strate, but you have to give her more on a
grade.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite interesting,” said Lanny. “And thanks
for explaining it to me.”</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s all right,” replied the other good-naturedly.
“Maybe, though, you’ll be afther my
job first thing I know.” He winked humorously.</p>

<p>Lanny smiled and shook his head. “I guess I’d
be afraid to try to run one of those alone,” he said.
“It looks pretty difficult. How was it, now, I
started it before?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“Wid this.” The engineer tugged gently at the
lever. “Try it again if you like.”</p>

<p>So Lanny stepped back on the platform and
rolled the machine a few yards up the road and
back again and seemed quite pleased and proud.
Nevertheless he still denied that he would have the
courage to try to do it alone. “I guess I’d better
start in and work up,” he said smilingly. “Maybe I
could get the job of night watchman for a beginning.
I suppose there is a watchman, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“There’s two or three of thim.”</p>

<p>Lanny tried not to let his disappointment show.
“That’s what I’ll do then,” he laughed. “And if I
get cold I’ll sit here by your boiler.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no watchman on this job,” said the
other carelessly. “We just put the lanterns up.
That’s enough. It’s only where there’s a good dale
of travelin’ that they do be havin’ the watchman
on the job. Well, here’s where we get busy. Come
along, you ould teakettle. The boss wants you.
So long, lad.”</p>

<p>The little roller rumbled off up the road and
Lanny, whistling softly, wandered back the way
he had come, stopping here and there to watch
operations. But once around the corner he no
longer dawdled. He set out at his best pace instead,
went a block westward and one northward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and presently reached his destination, a house at
the corner of Troutman and B Streets. Dick Lovering’s
blue runabout was in front of the gate and
Dick himself was sitting on the porch with Gordon
Merrick. Gordon was a clean-cut, live-looking boy
of sixteen, a clever first-baseman and an equally
clever left end. He and Dick were close friends.
They had evidently been awaiting Lanny’s appearance,
for they spied him the moment he came into
sight and before he had reached the gate Gordon
called eagerly: “All right, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“Fine! I’m the best little chauffeur in the Street
Department!”</p>

<p>“Better not talk so loudly,” cautioned Dick. “Do
you have to have a license to run it?”</p>

<p>Lanny chuckled. “I guess so, but I’ve lost mine.
Say, fellows, it’s dead easy!” He seated himself
on the top step and fanned himself with his cap.
April was surprising Clearfield with a week of abnormally
warm weather and this Saturday morning
was the warmest of all. “The chap was awfully
decent to me. It seems rather a shame to take
him in the way I did. He let me get on it and
run it and showed me all about it. Why, all you
have to do——” And thereupon Lanny went into
technical details with enthusiasm and explained
until Gordon shut him off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“That’ll be about all, Lanny,” said Gordon. “As
you’re going to attend to the chauffeuring we don’t
need to know all the secrets. All we want to know
is, can it be done?”</p>

<p>“Of course! I’m telling you——”</p>

<p>“You’re spouting a lot of rot about steam pressure
and gauges,” interrupted Gordon firmly.
“That’s your business, not ours. We’re only passengers
and——”</p>

<p>“Leave me out,” laughed Dick. “I refuse to ride
on anything that Lanny’s running, even a street
roller.”</p>

<p>“There won’t any of you ride,” said Lanny.
“You’ll walk. And one of you had better go ahead
and carry a lantern in case we meet anything on
the way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks, it’s got a whistle, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I’m not going to blow it if it has,
you silly idiot!”</p>

<p>“Much obliged! Well, do we do it to-night or do
we not?”</p>

<p>“We do. The journey will start at nine sharp.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better wait until later?” asked Dick.
“We don’t want to run into the Superintendent of
Streets or the fellow you were talking to.”</p>

<p>“There’s no one out that way at night. There
are only four or five houses around there, anyway.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
We can take it to that first new cross street, whatever
its name is, and then back by Common Street to
the field. We won’t meet a soul. Besides, it’s
going to take some time to go all over that ground
with the thing. It’s slower than Dick’s runabout!”</p>

<p>“Cast no aspersions on Eli,” warned Dick.
“We might have a race, you and I, eh? You in
your—what make is it, by the way?”</p>

<p>Lanny chuckled. “Well, it’s not very big,” he
said, “and so I guess maybe it’s a Ford!”</p>

<p>“Who’s going along with us?” Gordon asked.</p>

<p>“Just Way. Seeing that he’s manager——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we may need someone along whose dad
has a little money in case we get caught! Will you
fellows come here, then, about nine?”</p>

<p>“You’d better leave me out of it,” said Dick. “I’m
willing to share the responsibility but I wouldn’t
be any use to you. I’m an awful blunderer when
I try to stump around in the dark.”</p>

<p>“You could go in Eli,” said Gordon, “and take
me along.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing! You’ll walk ahead and lug the
lantern,” declared Lanny. “There’s no reason why
Dick should bother to come. Besides, if there did
happen to be any trouble about it afterwards, he’d
be much better out of it. A football coach isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
much use if he’s serving a year or two in prison.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they would do to us if
they found out?” asked Gordon thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, who cares?” Lanny laughed gaily. “After
all, we aren’t stealing the thing; we’re just borrowing
it.”</p>

<p>“I guess Ned Burns would intercede with his
stern uncle if we were found out,” said Dick.
“It might be a good idea to take Ned along!” he
added with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Ned nothing!” Gordon’s tone was contemptuous.
“Ned would get in front of the old thing and
get flattened out, like as not. Something would
happen to him surely. He can’t walk around the
corner without breaking a leg!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him now?” asked Lanny
interestedly. “Some fellow told me he was laid
up again.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear? Why, he was standing on a
crossing on Common Street one day last week and
an automobile came along and ran over his foot!
Everyone around declared that the chap in the
auto blew his horn loud enough to wake the dead.
But it didn’t wake Ned!”</p>

<p>“Hurt him much?” asked Lanny, laughing.</p>

<p>“Broke a bone in one toe, they say. Honest, I
saw Ned walk along G Street one day last winter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
and run into exactly three hydrants! He’s a wonder!”</p>

<p>“He certainly is! And I guess we’d better leave
Ned at home. Three of us are enough, anyway.
What time does the moon show up to-night?”</p>

<p>“It hasn’t told me,” replied Gordon gravely.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll need it to see what we’re doing.
About ten, though, I think. Is that twelve o’clock
striking? Gee, I must run along. I promised my
mother I’d dig up a flower bed this morning. See
you later, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Wait a second and I’ll drop you around there,”
said Dick, reaching for his crutches. “By the way,
Gordie, if you see Way tell him not to forget to
stop and get half a dozen new balls. I told him
yesterday, but he’s likely to forget it. And don’t
you forget that practice is at two-thirty to-day!”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir! Can we have a game to-day,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I want a good hour’s work beforehand.
Turn her over, will you, Lanny? I’m going
to have a self-starter put on her some day if I can
find the money.”</p>

<p>Eli Yale, that being the full name of the blue
runabout, rolled out of sight up B Street toward
Lanny’s home and Gordon, reminded by Lanny’s
remark of his own duties in the way of gardening,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
descended the porch and passed around the side
of the house toward the shed in search of a spade.
As he came in sight of the apple tree in the next
yard he glanced inquiringly toward the platform.
It was, however, empty.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” muttered Gordon, “where Fudge is
keeping himself. I haven’t seen him around for
almost a week.”</p>

<p>Could he have caught sight of his neighbor at
that moment he would probably have been somewhat
surprised.</p>

<small>THE NEW SIGN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Quit wobbling!” hissed Fudge.</p>

<p>“All right, but hurry up,” returned Perry
in a hoarse whisper. “See anything?”</p>

<p>“N-no, nothing much. There’s a table—what’s
that?”</p>

<p>Fudge stopped abruptly and listened. Footfalls
sounded in the hall below and, releasing his clutch
on the ledge of the transom, Fudge wriggled from
Perry’s supporting arms and descended to the
floor.</p>

<p>“Someone’s coming!” he whispered. “Beat it!”</p>

<p>They “beat it” into the empty room across the
corridor just as the intruder’s head came into sight
above the landing. Fudge, watching through the
crack of the partly-open door, beheld a man in
overalls carrying a square of black tin. He passed
on to the door they had just retreated from, set
down his box, pushed a battered derby hat to the
back of his head and regarded the portal thoughtfully.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Finally he produced an awl, a screwdriver
and some screws from different pockets and proceeded
to attach the square of tin to the middle
panel. The conspirators watched with vast curiosity.
There was printing on the tin, but not until
the man had completed his task and gone were
they able to read it. Then they stole out and regarded
the sign interestedly. This is what they
saw:</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="noic">MYRON ADDICKS,</p>

<p class="p2 noic">CIVIL ENGINEER</p>
</div>

<p>They viewed each other questioningly and doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Civil Engineer,” mused Fudge. “That’s a
funny game. Of course, that isn’t his real name.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of here,” said Perry uneasily. “He
might come back.”</p>

<p>They went down the stairs and emerged on the
sidewalk after Fudge had peered cautiously from
the doorway. “I suppose,” muttered Fudge, “we
oughtn’t to be seen together. He may be watching
from across the street somewhere.” He viewed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the windows of the opposite stores and houses
suspiciously but without result. In another minute
they were seated on Perry’s front steps.</p>

<p>“What did you see through the transom?” asked
Perry.</p>

<p>“Nothing much. There’s a cot bed in one corner
with a screen around it, and a table with a lot
of books and things on it, and a funny table with
a sloping top, and a little table near the window,
and two or three chairs——” Fudge paused,
searching his memory. “That’s all, I guess.
There’s a closet in the corner across from the
bed, though. And, oh, yes, there was a trunk near
the door. I could just see the edge of it. I’ll bet
if we could get a look in that trunk we’d find evidence
enough, all right!”</p>

<p>“But—but if he’s really a civil engineer,” objected
Perry, “maybe we’re all wrong about him.”</p>

<p>Fudge jeered. “What would a civil engineer be
doing playing a piano in a movie theater? And why
would he wear a false mustache? Or dress up like
a cowboy? He’s no more of a civil engineer than
I am!”</p>

<p>“Myron’s an unusual name,” mused Perry.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t expect him to call himself John
Smith, would you? Folks would suspect right away
that it was a—an assumed name. He’s foxy, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
chap. I’ll just bet you anything that he’s a regular
top-notcher! And I’ll bet there’s a whaling big
reward out for him, too!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see that we’ve found out very
much to-day,” said Perry. “We’ve been after him
ever since half-past eight, and all we know is that
he calls himself ‘Myron Addicks, Civil Engineer’
and has a trunk and a bed and three tables in his
room.”</p>

<p>“That’s a whole lot,” replied Fudge emphatically.
“That sign proves that he’s a faker, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t exactly <em>prove</em> it,” returned the
other.</p>

<p>“Of course it does! You don’t suppose anyone
really ever had such a name as ‘Myron Addicks,’
do you? And I guess you never saw a civil engineer
playing a piano in a theater, did you? And
what about the disguise?”</p>

<p>There was no getting around the disguise, and
Perry hedged. “Well, anyway, we’ve got to find
out more than we have yet, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll find things out all right. And I
guess we’ve got plenty of time. That sign shows
that he means to hang around here awhile, you
see. If he was going to crack a safe within a few
days he wouldn’t go to all that trouble. I guess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
he’s about as slick as they make them. Say, what
time is it? I’ve got to get home!”</p>

<p>“About half-past twelve. Do we have to do any
more shadowing this afternoon?”</p>

<p>Fudge shook his head. “No, he’ll be in the theater
from two to half-past four. Anyway, I’ve got to
think over the new evidence before we go on. We—we’ve
got to proceed very carefully. If he
should suspect anything—well, it might go hard
with us.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” said Perry dubiously, “we could find
out if there really is a reward out for him. Only,
if there was, I don’t suppose we could get it.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t we?” demanded Fudge warmly.
“All we’d have to do would be to go to the police
and say: ‘Come across with the reward and we’ll
lead you to your man!’ That’s all we’d have to
do. Of course I could go to the police station and
ask what rewards are out, but, you see, that might
make them suspicious. All they’d have to do
would be to shadow us and find out about him and—bing!—good-night,
reward!” Fudge shook his
head. “We won’t give them any chance to do us
out of it. Well, so long. Going out to the field
this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Are you?”</p>

<p>Fudge nodded. “Guess so. Come on and watch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
practice. Maybe they’ll have a game to-day. Stop
for me about two, will you?”</p>

<p>Perry agreed and Fudge took himself off, for
once neglecting to proceed along the street with his
usual caution. If an enemy had been lurking behind
one of the maple trees, Fudge would have
stood a poor chance of escape! Perry dragged his
tired feet into the house and up the stairs, reflecting
that this game of shadowing was far more wearying
than the long, slow runs that had fallen to his
lot the last three days. He was very thankful that
work for the track candidates was to be omitted
this afternoon.</p>

<p>However, he felt better after dinner and sitting
in the sun on the stand with Fudge and watching
baseball practice was not a very wearing occupation.
Dick Lovering put the fellows through a good
hour of batting and fielding and then picked two
teams from the more promising material and let
them play five innings. Tom Haley was in the
box for the First Team and Tom Nostrand pitched
for the Second. The First was made up about as
everyone expected it would be, with Captain Jones
at shortstop, Lanny catching, Gordon Merrick on
first, Harry Bryan on second, Will Scott on third,
George Cotner in left field, Pete Farrar in center
and Joe Browne in right. Bert Cable umpired. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
hundred or more fellows had come out to the field
to look on, attracted by the rumor of a line-up, and
they were rewarded by a very scrappy, hard-fought
contest. There were many errors, but, as they were
fairly apportioned to each team, they added to
rather than detracted from the interest.</p>

<p>The Scrubs tied the score up in the third when
Lanny, seeking to kill off a runner at second, threw
the ball two yards to the left of base and two tallies
came in. At four runs each the game went into the
last of the fourth inning. Then an error by the
Second Team’s first-baseman, followed by a wild
throw to third by catcher, brought Gordon Merrick
in and placed the First Team in the lead. And there
it stayed, for, although the Second started a rally
in their half of the fifth and managed to get men
on first and second bases with but one out, Tom
Haley settled down and fanned the next batsman
and brought the game to an end by causing his
rival in the points, Tom Nostrand, to pop up an
easy fly to Warner Jones.</p>

<p>Before Fudge and Perry were out of sight of the
field Dick’s runabout sped past with Gordon Merrick
beside the driver and Curtis Wayland perched
on the floor with his knees doubled up under his
chin. The occupants of the car waved and Way
shouted something that Perry didn’t catch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>“What did he say?” Perry asked as the car sped
around the corner.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” muttered Fudge. “He’s a fresh
kid, anyway.”</p>

<p>Fudge, however, was not quite truthful, for
Way’s remark had reached him very clearly.</p>

<p>“I thought,” said Perry innocently, “he said
something about the springs.”</p>

<p>Fudge viewed him suspiciously, but, discovering
his countenance apparently free of guile, only
grunted.</p>

<p>In the runabout the three boys were discussing
the afternoon’s performance. “It didn’t go badly
for a first game,” hazarded Way. “But wasn’t
that a weird peg of Lanny’s?”</p>

<p>“There were several weird things about that
game,” said Gordon. “My hitting was one of
them. We’ll have to do better next Saturday if
we’re going to beat Norrisville.”</p>

<p>“Who said we were going to?” asked Dick
mildly.</p>

<p>Gordon laughed. “Well, then, give them a fight,”
he corrected.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll do that, I guess,” Dick replied. “Another
week of practice will make a difference. We’ll
get rid of some of the crowd about Wednesday and
then we’ll have room to turn around out there.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Warner thinks we ought to keep two full nines for
the First, but I don’t see the use of it if we have
the Second to play with. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“No use at all,” said Way. “Just a lot of soreheads
sitting around on the bench and kicking because
they can’t play every minute. Besides, there
aren’t enough good ball players in the lot to make
three teams.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think there are. That’s what I told
Warner. He wanted to pick out eighteen or twenty
and then make up the Second from what was
left.”</p>

<p>“A peach of a Second it would be,” jeered Gordon.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll stick to last year’s idea,” continued
the coach, “and keep about sixteen fellows, including
pitchers. I wish, by the way, we had another
good twirler. We’ll have to find one somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Joe Browne can pitch a little, Dick,” Way
suggested. “You might see what you can do with
him. He hasn’t got much, I guess, but a pretty
fair straight ball and a sort of out-curve, but he
might learn.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll see what we can do with him.
A player who can work in the field and the box too
is a pretty handy chap to have around. If he can
do well enough to start some of the early games<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
we won’t have to keep more than fifteen players.
Here you are, Way. Everything all right for to-night?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. Lanny’s going to leave the big gate
open so we can get the thing in. I hope he doesn’t
forget it. I’ll call him up at supper time and
find out. Sure you don’t want to come along,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure. I’d only be in the way. And you’ll
have plenty without me. Good luck to you. Don’t
get caught!”</p>

<p>“If we do we’ll get you to bail us out,” laughed
Way, as he swung the gate to behind him. “Nine
o’clock sharp, Gordon!”</p>

<p>Gordon nodded and the car went on again. “I’m
rather afraid you’ll get nabbed,” remarked Dick.
“But I don’t suppose anyone would be nasty about
it. If I were you fellows I’d cut and run, Gordie,
if anything happened.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we will,” Gordon replied. “If we do
I hope Lanny will turn off the engine before he
jumps!”</p>

<p>“Well, drop around in the morning and let me
hear about it,” said the other as Gordon jumped
out at his gate. “If I don’t see an announcement
of your arrest in the paper I’ll take it that you got
through all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“You won’t see any announcement of my arrest,”
laughed Gordon. “I can run faster than any cop
on the force, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Well, see that you do! So long!”</p>

<small>THE BORROWED ROLLER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Some twelve years before a large tract of
marsh and meadow lying west of the town
and southeast of the river where it turns
toward the sea had been purchased by Mr. Jonathan
Brent. At the time no one conceived that any of
the land except possibly a few blocks just beyond
A Street would ever be marketable as residence lots.
But Mr. Brent had gradually filled in, driving back
the twisting creeks that meandered about the land,
until many acres had been redeemed. Several new
streets were laid out and Mr. Brent, retaining for
his own occupancy a full block between Sawyer and
Troutman Streets, had built himself a very handsome
residence. “Brentwood” was quite the finest
mansion in Clearfield. When finished it was two
blocks beyond the westernmost house in town, but
it did not remain so long. Brent’s Addition proved
popular and many citizens bought lots there and
built, in some cases abandoning homes in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of town that were already being elbowed by
business blocks. Between Main and Common
Streets, three blocks north of “Brentwood,” two
squares had been left undivided and this ground
was now the High School Athletic Field. West of
that, building had not progressed to any great extent
as yet, although a few houses were scattered
about the recently-made area. It was in this locality
at about half-past nine that Saturday
night Lanny, Gordon, Way and one other found the
street rollers.</p>

<p>The fourth member of the expedition was Morris
Brent. Morris, it seemed, had recalled the fact
that he had left a tennis racket and some balls on
the court at the side of the house and had gone
out to bring them in. On his return he had chanced
to look toward the front gate and had glimpsed
the three figures going west along Troutman Street.
There was nothing extraordinary about that, but
Morris had been impressed with a certain stealthiness
displayed by the trio, and had also caught
sight of a tow head under the dim light of a street
lamp. Thereupon Morris had abandoned racket
and balls on the front steps and hastened after the
conspirators, finding that his surmise as to the
identity of the light-haired youth was correct. His
advent was welcomed, the purpose of the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
explained to him and the trio became a quartette.</p>

<p>Save Morris not a person was glimpsed from
Gordon’s house to their destination. The only person
they were likely to meet was the policeman
on that beat, and, since he had to cover a deal of
territory, and was known to have a partiality for
the better lighted district nearest town, the boys
considered their chances of evading him were excellent.
Making certain that there was no watchman
about, they approached the smaller of the two
rollers and considered it. It would have to be
turned around and run back a half-block to the
next street, north two blocks and then east to the
Common Street side of the athletic field. The first
difficulty that presented itself was that, contrary to
the statement of the engineer, the fire under the
boiler was not banked. In fact, there was very
little fire there. This was explained by Morris.
Being Saturday, he said, the engineers had left
their fires to go out so they would not have to tend
them until Monday morning.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the dickens?” asked Lanny. He lifted
down a red lantern that hung from the engine and
dubiously examined the steam gauge. “About ten
pounds,” he muttered. “She won’t stir a step on
that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>“Guess, then, we’d better try it some other time,”
said Way.</p>

<p>“No, sir, we’re going to do it to-night,” responded
Lanny, after a moment’s consideration. “If we
wait until the first of the week the field may dry
off, and we want to roll it while it’s still moist.
The only thing to do is to get this fire going and
make steam. It’ll take some time, but we can do
it.”</p>

<p>“Easy,” agreed Morris. Being newly admitted
to the conspiracy, Morris was filled with enthusiasm.
“Set the lantern down, Lanny, and I’ll shovel some
coal on.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll rake it a bit first, though.” This
was done and then, from the bin, Morris got several
shovelfuls of soft coal and sprinkled it gingerly
over the dying fire. Drafts were opened and the
quartette sat down to wait. Fortunately, the night
was fairly warm, otherwise the ensuing period
might have been distinctly unpleasant, for this
newer part of Brent’s Addition was beautifully
level, and what breeze was stirring came across the
land unimpeded by anything larger than the two-inch
shade trees along the incipient sidewalks. They
talked in low tones, keeping a careful watch meanwhile
for the policeman. The last street light was
at the end of the block and so, save for the lanterns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
left by the workmen, they were in the darkness.
Lanny, though, pointed to the sky back of the town.
“The moon’s coming up,” he said, “and I’d like
mighty well to be inside the field before it gets in
its work.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed Gordon. The next instant
he uttered a cautioning “<em>S-s-sh!</em>” and flattened himself
out against the side of the roller. Half a block
away the officer on the beat had suddenly emerged
from the shadows and was standing under the light,
gazing, as it seemed to the boys, most interestedly
toward them. There was a minute of suspense.
“Think he saw us?” whispered Gordon.</p>

<p>“Search me,” said Lanny. “I wish we’d had
the sense to put the lantern back on the other side
where we got it. Here he comes!”</p>

<p>The officer had begun a slow but determined approach.</p>

<p>“Keep in the shadows,” advised Lanny, “and beat
it back to the other roller! Don’t let him see
you!”</p>

<p>Silently, like four indistinct shadows, the boys
slipped from their places and, keeping as best they
could the dark bulk of the roller between them and
the approaching policeman, scuttled up the road to
where the larger machine stood. There was one
doubtful moment when the light of the red lantern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
fell upon them just before they dodged behind the
big roller.</p>

<p>“He will see the fire and know that something’s
up,” whispered Way. “Let’s skip, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” advised Lanny. “Maybe he
won’t. Wait and see.”</p>

<p>They peered anxiously around the edges of the
big wheel behind which they were hidden. The
policeman was dimly visible as he walked about the
smaller roller. Finally he stopped and swung his
stick a moment, picked up the red lantern and set
it in the road beside the machine and, at last, slowly
ambled back along the street. Breathlessly and
hopefully they watched him reach the corner and
disappear without a backward look. For a long two
minutes after that they listened to the sound of his
footsteps dying away on the new granolithic sidewalk.
Then:</p>

<p>“Saved!” murmured Morris dramatically.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Lanny. “We’ll have to get
that old shebang going even if we have to push it!
The moon will be up in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>When they got back there was an encouraging
purring sound from the engine and, without disturbing
the lantern, Lanny borrowed a match from
Morris and read the gauge. “Forty-something,”
he muttered as the light flickered out. “We’ll try<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
her, anyway. Sneak back there to the corner, Gordon,
and see if you can hear or see anything of the
cop. And hurry back. I’ll get her swung around,
anyway.”</p>

<p>Gordon scouted off and Lanny, while the other
two boys held their breath anxiously, pulled a
lever here, pushed something there and turned the
wheel. There was a hiss, a jar, a <em>clank</em> and a rumble
and the roller slowly moved away from the curbing.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“She starts, she moves, she seems to feel</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The thrill of life along her keel!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">murmured Morris poetically as Lanny sought excitedly
for the reversing lever in the darkness.
The roller stopped suddenly and as suddenly began
to back. Way, who had followed close behind, had
just time to jump aside with a suppressed yelp before
the ponderous machine struck the curb with an
alarming jolt.</p>

<p>“Keep her head down!” exclaimed Morris.
“Don’t let her throw you, Lanny!”</p>

<p>“Give me that lantern up here,” panted the amateur
engineer. “I can’t see what I’m doing.”</p>

<p>Way handed the lantern to him and he hung it
on a projection in front of him. After that progress
was less erratic. It required much maneuvering to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
get the roller headed the other way, but Lanny at
last accomplished the difficult feat. Gordon returned
to report that all was quiet. More coal was
put into the furnace and the journey begun. Lanny’s
plan to have someone walk ahead with a lantern
was abandoned. Instead the light was put out
and Lanny trusted to the faint radiance of the
moon which was not yet quite above the house-tops.
The corner was negotiated without difficulty and the
Flying Juggernaut, as Gordon dubbed the machine,
swung into a smooth, newly-surfaced street over
which she moved easily if not silently. Gordon and
Morris strode ahead to watch for obstructions and
give warning while Way, as a sort of rear guard,
remained behind in case pursuit appeared from that
direction.</p>

<p>What each of the four marveled at was why
the entire town did not turn out to discover the
reason for the appalling noise! Perhaps the sound
of the steam roller’s passage was not as deafening
as they imagined, but to them it seemed that
the thumping and rattling and groaning could easily
be heard on the other side of town! If it was,
though, nothing came of it. Slowly but with a sort
of blind inexorability quite awesome the Juggernaut
proceeded on her way. Lanny, his hand on the
lever that would bring her to a stop, stood at his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
post like a hero, ready, however, to cut and run at
the first alarm. It seemed the better part of an
hour to him before the two blocks were traversed
and Morris came back to announce that Common
Street was reached. Over went the wheel and the
Flying Juggernaut, grazing the curbing with a
nerve-destroying rasp of steel against stone, turned
toward the side entrance of the field. On the left
now were several houses. Lights shone from windows.
The boys held their breath as the last leg
of the journey began. Suppose that, hearing the
noise and viewing the unusual sight of a steam roller
parading through the street at half-past ten o’clock,
some busy-body should telephone to the police station!
Morris didn’t like to think of it, and so, naturally,
he mentioned it to Gordon. Gordon assured
him that the contingency had already occurred to
him and that if he saw a front door open he meant
to disappear from the scene with unprecedented
celerity, or words to that effect!</p>

<p>But the suspense ended at last, for there, on the
right, a break in the shadowed darkness of the
high fence, was the open gate. Lanny swung the
roller far to the left and turned toward the entrance.
Then, however, a problem confronted them,
which was how to get it over the curbing! They
hadn’t planned for that. The sidewalk was a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
six inches above the street level, and, bringing the
Juggernaut to a stop—the sudden silence was absolutely
uncanny!—Lanny invited ideas. Morris
offered the desperate plan of backing the roller to
the far side of the street and putting on all steam.
“Sort of lift her over, Lanny,” he urged. Lanny
told him he was an idiot; that this thing was a
steam roller and not a horse. In the end Morris,
Way and Gordon went inside to look for planks or
beams to lay along the curb, while Lanny, not too
contented with his task, remained to guard the
roller. They were gone a long time, or so, at least,
it seemed to the engineer, but returned at last with
enough lumber of varying lengths and thicknesses
to answer the purpose. In the light of the inquiring
moon, which was now sailing well above the
tree-tops, they snuggled the planks and joists against
the curbing, forming an abrupt but practical runway,
and, giving the Juggernaut all the steam there
was, Lanny persuaded her to take the incline and
to roll majestically through the gate and into the
field. No sooner was she inside than Gordon swung
the gate shut and secured it, and four boys, with one
accord, drew four long, deep-drawn breaths of relief!</p>

<small>GORDON DESERTS HIS POST</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">After that they listened cautiously, but heard
only the soft sizzling of the engine which had
a contented sound as though the Flying Juggernaut
was quite as rejoiced at the successful outcome
of the venture as they were! More coal was
put on, the grate was raked and Lanny contentedly
announced that there was a sixty-pound head
of steam on. By this time the field was bathed
in moonlight save where the stands cast their black
shadows, and the task remaining could not fail for
lack of light. Forward moved the Juggernaut and
there began the work of smoothing out the inequalities
of Brent Field. Perhaps had Lanny realized
the size of the task he would never have ventured
on it. Back and forth, commencing at the infield
end, rumbled and clanked the roller, each time
covering some four feet of sward and gravel. An
hour passed and they were still only as far as first
and third base. Gordon voiced doubts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“At this rate, Lanny, we won’t reach the fence
back there before breakfast time. Can’t you make
her go any faster?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t,” replied the engineer shortly, “and
if you don’t like the way I’m doing this suppose you
take a whack at it yourself.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I’d probably run her right through
the stand over there. I’m not criticising your
handling of the thing, Lanny, but it’s getting a bit
chilly and I’m sleepy and——”</p>

<p>“Go on home then. I guess I can do this all right
alone.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be grouchy,” said Way. “After
all, you’re the only one of us who’s getting any
fun out of it. Just walking back and forth like
this isn’t awfully exciting. Gee, I wish I had my
sweater!”</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” said Morris. “I’ll beat it down
town and get some hot coffee!”</p>

<p>“Oh, noble youth!” applauded Gordon. “Get a
gallon of it, Morris! And some sandwiches——”</p>

<p>“Or hot-dogs,” interpolated Way.</p>

<p>“With plenty of mustard!”</p>

<p>“Who’s got any money? I don’t think I’ve got
more than fifteen or twenty cents. Dig down, fellows.”</p>

<p>They “dug” and a minute later Morris was on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
his way with the sufficient sum of eighty cents
jingling in his pocket. Cheered by the anticipation
of hot coffee and food, the others were restored to
good humor. Lanny said he guessed the old concern
would get along just as fast if they all got on
it. They tried it and could see no difference in the
rate of progress, and being near the boiler was a lot
warmer than walking along in the little breeze that
had come up with the moon. At Gordon’s suggestion,
Lanny instructed him in running the machine
and, after a few trips back and forth, he took
Lanny’s place at the throttle while the latter was
glad to get down and stretch his legs. They completed
the diamond and started on the outfield.
Lanny declared that the work was a huge success,
that the ground where they had rolled was as hard
and level as a billiard table.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he added, “it would be a lot better
if we could go over it two or three times.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Gordon hurriedly, “but we’re not
going over it two or three times, you simple idiot!
Once is enough. My folks hate to have me late for
breakfast!”</p>

<p>“One good thing,” said Way, “is that to-morrow—no,
to-day—is Sunday and we have breakfast
later.”</p>

<p>“So do we,” replied Gordon, “but I’m wondering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
if I can sneak in without being caught. Wish I’d
thought to unlock the porch window. I supposed
we’d be all done with this by twelve!”</p>

<p>“If we get it done by four we’ll be lucky, I guess,”
said Lanny. “There comes Morris.”</p>

<p>“I could only get a quart,” panted Morris as he
came up. “The chap in the lunch wagon was afraid
he’d run short if he gave me any more. Here are
some paper cups; got those at the drug store. And
here’s your grub; eight ham and three hot-dog sandwiches.”</p>

<p>“Three?” ejaculated Gordon.</p>

<p>“Yes, I ate one on the way. Stop your old pushcart
till we feed.”</p>

<p>“Better keep her going,” said Lanny. “We can
eat <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en voyage</i>.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t get any of that,” replied Morris flippantly.
“They were all out of it. Hold your cup,
Way. Is it hot? I came back as fast as I could,
but——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” sputtered Way. “It’s hot
enough to scald you. Good, too! M-mm!”</p>

<p>For several minutes conversation ceased and only
the rumble and clank of the roller broke the silence.
Then, when the last crumb was gone and the paper
cups had been added to the flames, there were four
contented grunts. “That’s better,” said Lanny.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
“I’m good for all night now. Let me have her,
Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit. I’m having too good a time. What
time is it?”</p>

<p>“About quarter to one,” answered Way, studying
the face of his watch in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“That’s not so bad. How much more have we
got, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“I’d say we’d done just about half,” was the reply.
“Better stop her and coal up a little.”</p>

<p>“No stops this trip,” answered Gordon. “Coal
ahead. I’ll get over here.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with letting me work her a
bit?” asked Morris, when the door was shut again.
“Seeing that I saved your lives——”</p>

<p>“Morris, old pal,” replied Gordon, gravely, “this
requires science and experience. I’d let you take
her in a minute, but if anything happened to her
I’d be held responsible. You can be fireman, though,
and shovel coal.”</p>

<p>“Next time you can get your own coffee,” grumbled
Morris. “I had just enough money, by the
way, to pay the lunch wagon chap, but I had to
charge the drinking cups to you, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“That’s more than I could do at Castle’s,”
laughed Gordon. “Whoa! Gee, I didn’t know that
track was so close!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“Get out of there before you go through the
fence,” said Lanny, pushing him aside. “Do you
suppose we’d ought to roll the track, too, fellows?”</p>

<p>A chorus of “No’s” answered him. “Wouldn’t
do the least bit of good,” added Way. “The track’s
in rotten shape anyhow. I don’t see why we have
to have the old thing. It’s only in the way. If you
have to go back for a long fly it’s a safe bet you
fall over the rim. What we ought to do is sod it
over and——”</p>

<p>“Tell that to Guy Felker,” advised Gordon.
“Have you done any work with the team yet,
Lanny?”</p>

<p>“I’ve had a couple of trials just to see what I
could do. Guy is after me to give him three afternoons
a week. I suppose I’ll have to pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother the Track Team,” said Way. “It
won’t amount to anything and you’ll lose baseball
practice. Cut it out this year, Lanny.”</p>

<p>“Not much! If it came to a show-down I’d
rather run the hundred and two-twenty than play
ball. And don’t you be mistaken about the team
being no good. We’re going to have a mighty good
team this year and we’re going to simply run away
from Springdale. You wait and see.”</p>

<p>“What of it if we do?” grumbled Way. “Who
cares?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Most everyone except you, you old pudding-head,”
responded Gordon. “Want me to take her
awhile now, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you kindly. Guy’s having a pretty
hard time to get fellows interested in the track, and
that’s a fact, but he’s going to win out all right.
Don’t go around talking like that, Way, because
it isn’t fair. Just because you don’t care
for track sports, you needn’t discourage other fellows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t said anything to discourage anyone.
For that matter, if Guy wants to get a team
together I wish him luck. But I don’t think there’s
room for football and baseball and track, too. We
ought to—to concentrate.”</p>

<p>“Rot! Let’s beat Springdale at every old thing
we can. Them’s my sentiments,” announced Morris.
“If we could do ’em up at tiddley-winks I’d be
in favor of starting a team!”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you’d play left wink on it,”
laughed Way.</p>

<p>It was well after three o’clock before the Flying
Juggernaut completed her last trip across the field
and the moon was well down toward the west. Four
very tired boys—and sleepy, too, now that the
effects of the coffee were working off—rolled across
to the gate, unbarred it, rolled through, closed it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
behind them, and set off again along Common
Street. Somehow they cared less about discovery
now and didn’t even take the trouble to lower their
voices as they rumbled past the darkened houses.
Morris announced that they had made a mistake in
the name of the steam roller; that its right name
was “Reverberating Reginald.” The others were
too sleepy to argue about it, however.</p>

<p>Gordon, who had taken Lanny’s place at the
wheel, turned into the cross street and headed Reginald
toward his berth. They didn’t take the precaution
to send scouters ahead now, and perhaps it
wasn’t worth while since the street lay plainly
before them for several blocks. And perhaps what
happened would have happened just the same.
Lanny always insisted that it wouldn’t, but never
could prove his point. At all events, what did happen
was this:</p>

<p>Just as they had trundled over the crossing at
Main Street a voice reached them above the noise
of the roller and a figure suddenly stepped into the
road a few yards ahead. One very startled glance
at the figure was sufficient. With a fine unanimity
four forms detached themselves from the sheltering
gloom of the steam roller and fled back along the
road. Possibly the policeman was so surprised at
the sudden result of his challenge that pursuit did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
not occur to him, or, possibly, the continued stately
advance of the steam roller in his direction disconcerted
him. At all events the boys became mere
flying shapes in the distance before the officer took
action. When he did he stepped nimbly out of the
path of the roller and remarked stentoriously as it
rumbled by:</p>

<p>“Hi, there! What’s this? Where you goin’
with that roller, hey?”</p>

<p>As there was no response he went after it, discovering
to his surprise that the reason he had
received no reply was that there was no one there
to offer it! What occurred subsequently would
have hugely diverted a spectator had there been
one, which there wasn’t. On and on went the roller,
moving further and further toward the sidewalk,
and on and on trotted the policeman, making ineffectual
efforts to board it. He had a very healthy
respect for engines and wasn’t at all certain that
this one might not resent his company. At last,
however, desperation gave him courage and he
stumbled onto the platform and began to pull, push
or twist every movable thing he could lay hands
on. The results were disconcerting. A cloud of
white steam burst forth from somewhere with an
alarming rush and hiss, a shrill, excruciating whistle
shattered the night and a tiny stream of very hot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
water sprayed down his sleeve! But the roller kept
right on rolling, majestically, remorselessly!</p>

<p>The policeman gave up in despair and rapped
loudly with his club for assistance. At that moment
the roller, heedless of his appeal, reached the intersection
of Lafayette Street and, no longer restrained
by the curbing against which it had been grinding,
angled purposefully across and collided violently
with a lamp-post. The lamp-post gave appreciably
under the unexpected assault and the light flared
wildly and expired. The steam roller, although its
further progress was barred, kept on revolving its
big wheels and the policeman, picking himself up,
rescued his helmet from the coal-box and hurried
from the scene.</p>

<small>ON DICK’S PORCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“After that,” said Gordon, “I don’t know just
what did happen. I was too busy getting
away from there to look back. I cut across
an open field and got into the shadow of the fence
on Louise Street and pretty soon Way came along.
Where Lanny and Morris got to I don’t know.
Maybe they’re still running!”</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning and Gordon and Dick
were seated on the latter’s porch. Dick, who had
listened to his friend’s narration with much amusement,
laughed again.</p>

<p>“And you forgot to turn off the steam before
you jumped, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t exactly forget to,” replied Gordon
judicially. “I thought of it, all right, but I couldn’t
locate the throttle thing. You see, it all happened
so suddenly that there wasn’t time to do much but
run. That silly cop must have been standing in
front of the little shed the contractors put up out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
there last year and we never suspected he was anywhere
around until he jumped out on us about
twenty feet ahead. He shouldn’t have done that.
He might have caused us heart-failure.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you been over yet to see what happened
to the roller?” Dick asked.</p>

<p>“I have not,” was the emphatic reply. “Maybe
this afternoon I’ll sort of happen out there, but it
might look suspicious if I went this morning. I
suppose there’ll be a dickens of a row about it.
There wasn’t anything in the paper, was there?”
Gordon glanced at the Sunday <cite>Reporter</cite> on Dick’s
knees.</p>

<p>“No, but I suppose the paper was out before it
happened. Do you think the policeman recognized
any of you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He might. We didn’t give him
much chance, but, still, it was broad moonlight.
Gee, I’d like to know what happened to that
roller!”</p>

<p>“Call up the police station and ask,” suggested
Dick gravely.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will!” But Gordon’s tone contradicted
the statement. “Guess I’ll call up Lanny and see if
he got home. I had a fine time getting in. There
wasn’t a window unlatched and I had to squirm
through the coal hole. I made a horrible noise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
when I dropped, too. I thought the coal would
never get through sliding!”</p>

<p>“Did you get caught?”</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head doubtfully. “I guess
mother knows, all right, but I don’t think dad does.
Anyway, he didn’t say anything. It was fierce
having to get up at eight o’clock! I felt like a—a——”</p>

<p>“You still look like it,” laughed Dick. “Well,
anyway, you got the job done, and that’s something,
even if you do go to jail for a while!”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they’ll do?” asked Gordon
uneasily.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe they’ll be hard on you.
Maybe a small fine and a month in jail.”</p>

<p>“Quit your kidding! If I go to jail I’ll see that
you come, too.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always understood that there was honor
even amongst thieves,” responded the other, “but I
see that I was—hello, see who’s here!”</p>

<p>It was Lanny who closed the gate behind him
and walked up the short path with a weary grin on
his face. “Good morning,” he said, as he sank to
the top step and leaned his head against the pillar.
“Also good-night.” He closed his eyes and snored
loudly.</p>

<p>“What became of you?” asked Gordon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“What became of me?” Lanny opened his eyes
protestingly. “When do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Last night, of course. Where did you run to?”</p>

<p>“Last night? Run? I don’t understand you. I
went to bed quite early last night and slept very
nicely. Once I thought I heard a noise, a sort of
jarring, rumbling noise, but I paid no attention to
it. What a beautiful morning it is! ‘O Beauteous
Spring, thou art——’” His head settled back
against the pillar again.</p>

<p>The others laughed, and Dick remarked soberly:
“I suppose you’ve heard that they got Morris?”</p>

<p>Lanny opened his eyes once more and winked
gravely. “I just had him on the phone a few minutes
ago.” He smiled wanly. “He couldn’t get in
the house when he got back and had to sleep out
in the stable in a carriage.”</p>

<p>“How about you?” asked Gordon.</p>

<p>Lanny waved a hand carelessly. “No trouble at
all. Merely shinned up a water-spout and got in
the linen closet window. Then I fell over a carpet-sweeper
and went to bed. I shall insist on having
a latch-key after this.”</p>

<p>“But where the dickens did you and Morris run
to?” insisted Gordon. “I never saw you once after
I turned into the field.”</p>

<p>“By that time I was shinning up the spout,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
replied Lanny. “You see, I had a fine start on you,
Gordie. I don’t know just what my time was for
the distance, but I’ll bet it was mighty good. I’m
pretty sure that I did the first two-twenty yards in
something under twenty seconds! As for Morris,
I never saw him. He says he fell over something
and lay in the grass for about half an hour and then
went home by way of the river. Something of a
detour, that!”</p>

<p>“Well, tell me one thing, Lanny,” said Dick.
“Did the rolling do the field any good?”</p>

<p>Lanny became almost animated. “It certainly
did! Want to go over and have a look at it?” Dick
shook his head. “Well, it made a lot of difference.
Of course, as I told the others, it ought to have been
gone over two or three times to get it in real good
shape, but it’s at least a hundred per cent. better
than it was before. I was afraid it might be too
dry, but it wasn’t. That old roller just squashed it
right down in great style. I think we broke the
board around the track in a few places, but it was
pretty rotten anyway.”</p>

<p>“That’s good; I mean about the field. As I just
said to Gordie, if you fellows have got to go to jail
it’s sort of a satisfaction that you accomplished
something. I’ll send you fruit and old magazines
now and then, and a month will soon pass.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“Is that really and truly so? Your kindness——”</p>

<p>“And I told <em>him</em>,” interrupted Gordon, “that if
we went to jail I’d see that he went along.”</p>

<p>“Naturally.” Lanny hugged his knees and smiled
pleasantly at Dick. “We couldn’t be happy without
you, Dickums. Yes, you’ll have to go along even
if it’s necessary for us to swear that you were the
ring-leader. I’d be sorry for your folks, Dick,
but——” Lanny shook his head inexorably. Then:
“By the by, what about Way?”</p>

<p>“I left him at the corner of Common Street,”
replied Gordon. “I guess he managed all right.”</p>

<p>“He ought to have; he’s the manager,” said
Lanny, with a yawn. “My word, fellows, but I’m
sleepy! And I had to pretend to be Little Bright-Eyes
at breakfast, too. I know I’ll fall asleep in
church and snore!”</p>

<p>“Do you think that cop recognized us, Lanny?”
Gordon asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me. If he did we’ll know about it
soon enough. Look here, whose idea was it, anyway?
Who got us into this scrape?”</p>

<p>“Of course, you didn’t,” answered Gordon
gravely, “and I’m certain I didn’t. I guess it was
Dick, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Lanny seemed about to assent until Dick reached
for a crutch. Then: “No, I don’t think it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Dick,” he replied. “You have only to look at his
innocent countenance to know that he would never
do such a thing. Guess it was Morris. He isn’t
here, and, besides, his dad’s got enough influence
and coin to buy him off. I’m certain it was Morris.”</p>

<p>“So it was; I remember now. Another time we’ll
know better than to listen to his evil suggestions.”
And Gordon sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“He’s older than we are, too, which makes it
more—more deplorable.”</p>

<p>“You have a wonderful command of the English
language this morning,” laughed Dick. “I’d love
to listen to you some time when you’re feeling fresh
and quite wide-awake!”</p>

<p>“Thank you for those few kind words,” responded
Lanny gratefully. “I shan’t attempt to
conceal from you the fact that I am slightly drowsy
to-day. Well, I’ve got to go back and report for
church parade. You coming, Gordie?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.” Gordon got up with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Come around after dinner,” suggested Dick,
“and we’ll get in Eli and take a ride. We might
roll around to the scene of the late unpleasantness
and see what finally happened to that roller!”</p>

<p>“All right,” Lanny agreed, “only don’t display
too great an interest in the thing when you get there.
Let us be—er—circumspect.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t like the sound of that word,” murmured
Gordon; “that is, the first and last syllables! Change
it to ‘cautious,’ Lanny.”</p>

<p>“Very well, let us be cautious. Farewell, Dickums!”</p>

<p>Their visit in the runabout to Brent’s Addition
that afternoon proved unsatisfactory. The steam
roller, looking as innocent as you like, was back
where they had found it and there was nothing to
tell what had happened subsequent to their hurried
departure. It was not until Monday morning that
they had their curiosity satisfied, and then it was
the <cite>Reporter</cite> that did it. The <cite>Reporter</cite> had chosen
to treat the story with humor, heading it</p>

<p class="noic adauthor">ROAD ROLLER RUNS AMUCK!</p>

<p class="noi">It told how Officer Suggs, while patrolling his
lonely beat on the outskirts of our fair
city, had had his attention attracted by mysterious
sounds on Aspen Avenue. The intrepid
guardian of the law had thereupon concealed himself
in ambush just in time to behold, coming toward
him, one of the Street Department’s steam
rollers. Ordered to stop and give an account of
itself, the roller had promptly attacked the officer.
The latter, with rare presence of mind, leaped to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
place of safety and the roller, emitting a roar of
rage and disappointment, tried to escape. Then followed
a vivid account of the pursuit, the disorderly
conduct of the roller, the wanton attack on the lamp-post
and the final subjugation and arrest of the
marauder, an arrest not consummated until several
members of the police force and employees of the
Street Department had been hurried to the scene.
It made a good story and at least five of the <cite>Reporter’s</cite>
readers enjoyed it vastly. To their relief
the paper ended with the encouraging statement that
“so far the police are unable to offer any satisfactory
explanation of the affair. Superintendent
Burns, of the Street Department, hints that some
person or persons unknown had a hand in the matter,
but to the <cite>Reporter</cite> it looks like a remarkable
case of inanimate depravity.”</p>

<p>And that ended the matter, save that eventually
the true story leaked out, as such things will, and
became generally known throughout the school.
Whether it ever reached the ears of Superintendent
Burns is not known. If it did he took no action.</p>

<p>Brent Field profited in any case. That Monday
afternoon the improvement in the condition of the
ground was so noticeable that many fellows remarked
on it. Fortunately, though, they were quite
satisfied with the casual explanation that it had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
“fixed up a bit,” and for some reason the marks left
by the passage of the roller, plainly visible, failed to
connect themselves with the story in that morning’s
paper. Perhaps the principal reason for this was
that very few of the fellows read anything in the
<cite>Reporter</cite> outside of the sporting page. The infield,
and especially the base paths, was more level and
smoother than it had ever been, and during practice
that afternoon there were far fewer errors that
could be laid to inequalities of the surface. To be
sure, when Harry Bryan let a ball bound through
his hands he promptly picked up a pebble and disgustedly
tossed it away, but the excuse didn’t carry
the usual conviction.</p>

<p>Practice went well that afternoon. Fielding was
cleaner and it really looked to Dick as though his
charges were at last finding their batting eyes.
Bryan, Cotner and Merrick all hit the ball hard in
the four-inning contest with the practice team, the
former getting two two-baggers in two turns at bat
and Cotner connecting with one of Tom Nostrand’s
offerings for a three-base hit. The First Team had
no trouble in winning the decision, the score being
5 to 1. Meanwhile, on the cinders the Track Team
candidates were busy, and over on the Main Street
side of the field, where the pits were located, the
jumpers and weight-throwers were trying themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
out as extensively as the ever-watchful
“Skeet” would allow. Fudge Shaw, looking heroic—and
slightly rotund—in a brand-new white shirt,
trunks and spiked shoes, was taking his turn with
the shot. So far only three other youths had chosen
to contest with him for the mastery in this event,
but unfortunately for Fudge two of the three were
older fellows with experience and brawn. One,
Harry Partridge, a senior and a tackle on the football
team, was in command of the shot-putters.
Partridge was a good sort usually, Fudge considered,
but to-day he was certainly impatient and censorious,
not to mention sarcastic!</p>

<p>“Look here, Fudge,” he asked after the tyro had
let the shot roll off the side of his hand and dribble
away for a scant twelve feet in a direction perilously
close to a passing broad-jumper, “who ever told you
you could put the shot, anyway? You don’t know
the first thing about it! Now come back here and
let me tell you for the fiftieth time that the shot
leaves your hand over the tips of your fingers and
doesn’t roll off the side. I’m not saying anything
just now about your spring or your shoulder work.
All I’m trying to do is to get it into that ivory knob
of yours that the shot rests <em>here</em> and that it leaves
your hand <em>so</em>! Now cut out all the movements and
let me see you hold it right and get it away right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>.
Thank you, that’s very rotten! Go ahead, Thad.
Try not to foul this time. You start too far forward.
That’s better! Did you see—look here,
Shaw, if you’re out here to put the shot you watch
what’s going on and never mind the jumpers! If
you don’t watch how these other fellows do it you
never will learn! All right, Falkland!”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Fudge when he and Perry were
walking home, “maybe I’d rather be a broad-jumper,
anyway. This shot-putting’s a silly stunt!”</p>

<small>FOILED!</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Whether Fudge really believed all he
professed to regarding the mysterious
occupant of Room 12 in the brick building
on G Street is a question. Fudge, being an
author of highly sensational romances, doubtless
possessed a little more imagination than common
and liked to give it free rein. Probably it is safe
to say that he believed about half. Perry, less imaginative
and far more practical, had been at first
taken in by Fudge and had really credited most if
not quite all that Fudge had asserted. When, however,
another week passed and nothing startling
happened, he began to lose faith. Almost every
morning the supposed desperado ate his breakfast
in full view of Perry very much as anyone else
would have eaten it, rationally clothed and exhibiting
absolutely none of the tricks or manners popularly
associated with criminals. He did not, for
instance, suddenly pause to glance furtively from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
the window. Nor did he ever, when Perry was
looking, shrug his shoulders as villains always did
on the screen at the theater. In short, as a criminal
he was decidedly disappointing!</p>

<p>One morning he actually laughed. Perry couldn’t
hear the laugh, but he could see it, and there was
nothing sardonic about it. It was just a jolly,
chuckling sort of laugh, apparently inspired by
something in the morning paper. Perry’s own
features creased in sympathy. After that Perry
found it very difficult to place credence in the “safe-breaker”
theory. Then, too, Fudge failed to develop
any new evidence. In fact, to all appearances,
Fudge had gone to sleep on his job. When
Perry mentioned the matter to him Fudge would
frown portentously and intimate that affairs had
reached a point where mental rather than physical
exertion counted most. Perry, though, was no
longer deceived.</p>

<p>“Huh,” he said one day, “there was nothing in
that yarn of yours and you’ve found it out. What’s
the good of pretending any more?”</p>

<p>Fudge looked sarcastic and mysterious but refused
to bandy words. His “If-you-knew-all-I-know”
air slightly impressed the other, and Perry
begged to be taken into the secret. But Fudge
showed that he felt wounded by his friend’s defection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
and took himself off in dignified silence. When
he had reached home and had settled himself on the
platform in the apple tree, however, Fudge realized
that his reputation and standing as an authority on
crime and its detection was in danger. Something,
consequently, must be done to restore Perry’s confidence.
But what? He thought hard and long, so
long that twilight grew to darkness before he left
his retreat and hurried to the house for supper. He
had, though, solved his problem.</p>

<p>The next day, which was Saturday, he presented
himself at Perry’s at a little after nine o’clock.
Perry, who had been practicing starts on the weed-grown
path at the side of the house, joined him
on the front porch somewhat out of breath and with
his thoughts far from the subject of crime and criminals,
clews and detectives. One glance at Fudge’s
countenance, however, told him that matters of importance
were about to be divulged. He pocketed
his grips and prepared to listen and be impressed.
Briefly, what Fudge had to say was this:</p>

<p>He had, he found, been slightly mistaken regarding
Mr. Myron Addicks. The mistake was a natural
one. It consisted of classifying Mr. Addicks
as a safe-breaker instead of a train-robber. Fudge
did not explain clearly by what marvelous mental
processes he had arrived at a knowledge of his error,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
or perhaps the fault was with Perry’s understanding.
At all events, the result was there and already
his new theory had been proven correct. He had
that very morning, not more than twenty minutes
ago, read, in the local office of the American Express
Company, a description of one “Edward Hurley,
alias John Crowell, alias John Fenney,” wanted
by the company for the robbery of an express car at
Cartwright, Utah, on February seventeenth last,
which exactly tallied with the appearance of Mr.
Myron Addicks, allowing, of course, for certain
efforts at disguise. Fudge had copied the salient
points of the placard in the express office and referred
now to his memorandum, written on the back
of a money order blank: “Age, about 28. Height,
5 feet, 10 inches. Weight, about 170 pounds. Dark
brown hair, blue eyes, complexion dark. Was clean-shaven
when last seen, but has probably grown
beard or mustache. Carries himself erect. Has
white scar about two inches in length on back of
left forearm.”</p>

<p>“There was a picture of him, too,” said Fudge,
“but I guess it wasn’t a very good one, because he
had his head thrown back and his eyes half closed
and was scowling like anything. It must have been
taken by the police.”</p>

<p>“What is the reward?” asked Perry breathlessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars, it said. Maybe they’d
pay more, though.”</p>

<p>“That would be two hundred and fifty apiece,”
reflected the other. “That wouldn’t be so bad,
would it? But—but it doesn’t seem to me that the
description is much like this fellow. Did the picture
look like him?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Fudge judicially, “it did and then
again it didn’t. You see, the fellow’s face was all
screwed up, and he didn’t have any mustache. A
mustache makes a lot of difference in your looks,
you know. But the description fits him to a T.
‘Dark brown hair, blue eyes——’”</p>

<p>“I don’t think this chap’s eyes are blue,
though.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you anything they are! What color are
they then?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” confessed Perry.</p>

<p>“No, and there you are! He’s about five feet,
ten inches high, isn’t he?” Perry nodded doubtfully.
“And he weighs about a hundred and seventy
pounds, doesn’t he? And his complexion’s dark
and he carries himself erect! And he has a false
mustache, and the notice said he would probably
have one. Oh, it’s our man all right! Don’t you
worry! Besides, don’t you see this explains his
wearing that cowboy get-up you saw him in? That’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
probably what he was. Lots of train-robbers were
cowboys first-off.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Perry thoughtfully. “But—but
supposing we proved it on him.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Would you want to—to give him away?”</p>

<p>Fudge hesitated. “I wouldn’t <em>want</em> to,” he said
at last, “but it’s the duty of a good citizen to aid in
the apprehension of lawbreakers, isn’t it? And,
besides, someone would get that five hundred sooner
or later, wouldn’t they? Bound to! You bet!
Well, there you are!”</p>

<p>But Perry looked unconvinced. “I don’t think
I’d like to,” he murmured presently. “Anyhow,
maybe we’re mistaken. Maybe his eyes aren’t blue.
If we could get a look at his arm——”</p>

<p>“That’s just what we’ve got to do,” replied Fudge.
“That’s what will tell.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t decided that yet. There are ways.
You leave it to me. I guess he’s just hiding out
here, Perry. I mean I don’t believe he is thinking
of doing another job just yet. He’s probably waiting
for this to blow over. I told you he was a
slick one!”</p>

<p>“But if he really was wanted for robbing that
train,” objected Perry, “it doesn’t seem to me he’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
show himself around the way he’s doing. He’d
hide, wouldn’t he, Fudge?”</p>

<p>“Where? He is hiding. He wears that mustache
and he’s trusting to that, you see. Why, if he went
sneaking around the police would notice him at
once, Perry. So he comes right out in public; makes
believe he’s a civil engineer and plays the piano in
a theater. You don’t suppose, do you, that the
police would ever think of looking in a moving
picture house for an escaped train-robber? Say,
he must sort of laugh to himself when he sees those
train-robbery films, eh?”</p>

<p>“But if he wears that mustache when he goes
out, Fudge, why does he take it off when he’s in
his room?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it isn’t comfortable. I should think it
mightn’t be.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he must know that most anyone can
see him when he sits at his window like that in the
morning.”</p>

<p>Fudge was silent for a moment. Then: “Perhaps
he doesn’t think of that,” he suggested weakly.
“Anyhow, what we’ve got to do is see first if his
eyes are blue, and after that whether he has a
scar on his arm. We might wait in front of the
theater this afternoon, only there’s the ball game
and we don’t want to miss that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“That isn’t until three, and the theater begins
at two.”</p>

<p>“That’s so! We’ll do it, then! I’ll be around
right after dinner, and we’ll watch for him. Say,
what would you do with two hundred and fifty
dollars, Perry?”</p>

<p>Perry shook his head. “I don’t know. Guess
I’d give it to dad, all but twenty-five dollars, maybe.
What would you?”</p>

<p>Fudge shook his head also. “Search me! Well,
we haven’t got it yet. I guess I could find things
to do with it all right. Say, you don’t suppose he’s
at his window now, do you?”</p>

<p>They ascended to Perry’s room and looked across,
but the opposite casement was vacant. Nor, although
they kept watch for a good ten minutes,
did they catch sight of the suspect. They returned
to the porch. “What we might do,” said Fudge
reflectively, “is go and see him and make believe we
wanted some civil engineering done.”</p>

<p>“We’d look fine doing that!” scoffed Perry.
“He’d know right away we were faking.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Fudge acknowledged. “We might
get someone else to do it, though.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Well, you might ask your father.”</p>

<p>“I might, but I’m not likely to,” was the derisive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
response. “Besides, all we’ve got to do is to get
a good look at him to see whether his eyes are blue
or not.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose folks can change the color
of their eyes, do you?”</p>

<p>“Of course not! How could they?”</p>

<p>Fudge shook his head. “Criminals know lots of
tricks we don’t,” he replied. “But we’ll soon see.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Perry went back to practicing starts
in the side yard and Fudge, finding a rock, gave
an interesting imitation of putting the shot.</p>

<p>They reached the theater at twenty-five minutes
before two. Fudge apologized for being a trifle
late, explaining that his mother had sent him on an
errand directly after dinner in spite of his plea of
an important engagement. Still, there was no doubt
but that they were in plenty of time, for the orchestra
did not assemble until a few minutes before two.
As there was already quite a throng awaiting the
opening of the doors, they decided to separate and
take opposite sides of the entrance. This they did,
Fudge assuming an expression and demeanor so
purposeless that Perry feared he would be arrested
as an escaped lunatic by the policeman on duty
there. Several hundreds of persons passed into
the theater, but neither of the boys caught sight of
their quarry, and when, at two o’clock, the strains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
of the orchestra reached them, they had to confess
themselves defeated. By that time the crowd had
thinned out to a mere dribble of late arrivals and
the officer was, or seemed to them to be, eyeing them
with growing suspicion. They were glad when they
had escaped from his chilly stare.</p>

<p>“I don’t see——” began Perry.</p>

<p>“I do!” Fudge interrupted bitterly. “We’re a
couple of chumps! Why, the orchestra chaps go
in the stage entrance, of course! And that’s around
in the alley off Pine Street! Gee, we’re a fine pair
of dummies, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>There was no denying it and so Perry mutely consented
with a sorrowful nod.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll know better next time,” said Fudge
more cheerfully. “Come on into Castle’s and have
a soda. Only it’ll have to be a five-center, because
I’m pretty nearly strapped. Sleuthing makes a
fellow thirsty.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the amateur detectives, forgetting
their defeat and cheered by two glasses of
cherry phosphate, started for the field.</p>

<small>THE GAME WITH NORRISVILLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">This afternoon’s contest was the first one of
the season with an outside team. Norrisville
Academy, since it was a boarding
school, had the advantage of being able to get into
condition rather earlier in the year than Clearfield
High School. To-day’s opponents had, in fact, been
practicing regularly since the latter part of February,
since they were so fortunate as to possess a
fine gymnasium with a big and practical baseball
cage. Aside from this advantage, however, Norrisville
had nothing Clearfield hadn’t, and if the
latter had enjoyed another fortnight of practice
Dick Lovering would have had no doubt as to the
outcome of the game. But as things were he told
himself that he would be quite satisfied if his
charges came through with something approaching
a close score.</p>

<p>It was a splendid April day, warm and still.
There were a good many clouds about, though, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
the morning paper had predicted showers. With
this in mind, Dick resolved to get a good start in
the first few innings, if that were possible, and so
presented a line-up that surprised the large audience
of High School rooters that had turned out
for the game. As set down in Manager Wayland’s
score-book, the order of batting was as follows:
Bryan, 2b; Farrar, cf; Merrick, 1b; Jones, ss; Scott,
3b; McCoy, lf; Breen, rf; White, c; Nostrand, p.
This arrangement in Dick’s present judgment presented
the team’s best batting strength. Tom Nostrand
was put in the box instead of Tom Haley,
since so far this spring he had out-hit the first-choice
pitcher almost two to one. It takes runs
to win a game and runs were what Dick was after.</p>

<p>Fudge, occupying one and a third seats behind
the home plate, flanked by Perry on one side and
Arthur Beaton, the Track Team Manager, on the
other, viewed the selection of talent dubiously.
More than that, he didn’t hesitate to criticize. Fudge
never did. He was a good, willing critic. No one,
though, took him seriously, unless, perhaps, it was
the devoted Perry, who, knowing little of baseball,
was ready to concede much knowledge of the subject
to his chum. Arthur Beaton, however, frankly
disagreed with Fudge’s statements.</p>

<p>“Forget it, Fudge,” he said. “Dick Lovering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
knew baseball when you were waving a rattle. Talk
about things you understand.”</p>

<p>“Of course he knows baseball. I’m not saying
he doesn’t, am I? What I’m telling you is that Joe
Browne’s a heap better fielder than Howard Breen.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but he isn’t worth two cents as a hitter.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. If a fellow fields well enough
he doesn’t have to be any Ty Cobb to make good.
It’s all right to go after runs, but if you let the
other fellow get runs, too, what good are you doing?
If they whack a ball into right field it’ll be good
for three bases, I tell you. Breen’s as slow as cold
molasses and can’t throw half-way to the plate!”</p>

<p>“You’d better slip down there before it’s too late
and tell that to Dick,” said Arthur sarcastically.
“He’d be mighty glad to know it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, old scout. You wait and see
if I’m not right. I just hope the first fellow up
lams one into right!”</p>

<p>He didn’t though; he popped a foul to Lanny and
retired to the bench. The succeeding “Norris-villains,”
as Fudge called them, were quickly disposed
of at first, and Harry Bryan went to bat for
the home team. Bryan was a heady batsman and
had a reputation for getting his base. He wasn’t
particular how he did it. He was a good waiter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
had a positive genius for getting struck with the
ball and could, when required, lay down a well-calculated
bunt. Once on the base, he was hard to
stop. On this occasion, he followed Dick’s instructions
and was walked after six pitched balls. Pete
Farrar waited until Clayton, the Norrisville pitcher,
had sent a ball and a strike over and then trundled
one down the first base path that started well but
unfortunately rolled out, to the immense relief of
the hovering Norrisville pitcher and first-baseman.
With two strikes against him, it was up to Pete to
hit out of the infield, but Captain Jones, coaching
at first, sent Bryan off to second and Pete’s swipe
at the ball missed. Bryan, though, was safe by
three feet, and the stands applauded wildly and
saw in imagination the beginning of Clearfield’s
scoring. But Bryan never got beyond second in
that inning. Gordon Merrick flied out to shortstop
and Captain Warner Jones, trying his best to hit
between second and short, lined one squarely into
second-baseman’s glove.</p>

<p>Nostrand held the enemy safe once more, although
the second man up got to first on Scott’s
error and slid safely to second when the third batsman
was thrown out, Scott to Merrick. A fly to
McCoy in left field ended the suspense.</p>

<p>It was Will Scott who started things going for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
the Purple. He was first up and caught the second
offering on the end of his bat and landed it in
short right for a single. McCoy sacrificed nicely
and Scott took second. Breen there and then vindicated
Dick’s judgment. After Clayton had put
himself in a hole by trying to give Breen what he
didn’t want, and after the onlookers had gone
through a violent attack of heart-failure when Will
Scott was very nearly caught off second, Breen
found something he liked the look of and crashed
his bat against it with the result that Scott sped
home and Breen rested on second.</p>

<p>Dick summoned Lanny and whispered to him
and Lanny nodded and strode to the plate swinging
the black bat that was his especial pride and affection.
Norrisville played in and Lanny did what
they expected he would try to do, but did it so well
that their defense was unequal to the task. His
bunt toward third was slow and short. Breen landed
on the next bag and Lanny streaked for first. Both
third-baseman and catcher went after the bunt and
there was an instant of indecision. Then third-baseman
scooped up the ball and pegged to first.
But Lanny, whose record for sixty yards was six
and four-fifths seconds, beat out the throw.</p>

<p>Nostrand played a waiting game and had two
strikes and a ball on him before Lanny found his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
chance to steal. Then, with a good getaway, he
slid to second unchallenged, Nostrand swinging and
missing. With men on third and second and but
one down, the world looked bright to the Clearfield
supporters, but when, a moment later, Nostrand’s
attempt at a sacrifice fly popped high and fell into
shortstop’s hands, the outlook dimmed.</p>

<p>But there was still hope of more runs. With
Bryan up, Clearfield might get a hit. The Norrisville
catcher, though, decided that Bryan would
be better on first than at bat and signaled for a
pass. Four wide ones were pitched and Harry trotted
to first and the bases were filled. Theoretically,
the Norrisville catcher was right, for with two out
three on bases were no more dangerous than two,
and he knew that the next batsman, Pete Farrar,
had earned his location in the line-up because of
his ability to sacrifice rather than to hit out. But
for once theory and practice didn’t agree. Farrar,
barred from bunting, resolved to go to the other
extreme and hit as hard and as far as he could—if
he hit at all. For a minute or two it looked as
though he was not to hit at all, for Clayton kept
the ball around Farrar’s knees and registered two
strikes against him before Pete realized the fact.
Then came a ball and then a good one that Pete
fouled behind first base. Another ball, and the tally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
was two and two. Again Pete connected and sent
the ball crashing into the stand. Clayton’s attempt
to cut the corner resulted badly for him, for the
umpire judged it a ball. Anxious coachers danced
and shouted jubilantly.</p>

<p>“He’s got to pitch now, Pete!” bawled Captain
Jones. “It’s got to be good! Here we go! On
your toes, Breen! Touch all the bases, Harry! Yip!
Yip! Yip! Yi——”</p>

<p>The last “Yip” was never finished, for just when
Warner was in the middle of it bat and ball met
with a <em>crack</em> and a number of things happened simultaneously.
The ball went streaking across the infield,
rising as it went, Breen scuttled to the plate,
Lanny flew to third, Harry Bryan sped to second,
Pete legged it desperately to first. Second-baseman
made a wild attempt to reach the ball, but it passed
well above his upstretched glove and kept on. Right-
and center-fielders started in, hesitated, changed
their minds and raced back. The spectators, on their
feet to a boy—or girl—yelled madly as fielders and
ball came nearer and nearer together far out beyond
the running track in deep center. A brief moment of
suspense during which the shouting died down to
little more than a murmur and then the outcome
was apparent and the yelling suddenly arose to
new heights. The fielders slowed down in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
shadow of the distant fence, but not so the ball. It
made a fine, heroic effort to pass out of the field
but couldn’t quite do it. Instead it banged against
the boards a few inches from the top and bounded
back. It was right-fielder who recovered it and
who, turning quickly, made a fine throw to second-baseman.
And second-baseman did all he could
to cut that hit down to a three-bagger, but Pete was
already scuttling to the plate when the ball left his
hand and the throw, being hurried, took the catcher
just far enough to the right to let Pete in. Pete,
catcher and ball became interestingly mixed together
for an instant in a cloud of dust and then the
umpire, stooping and spreading his arms with palms
downward, returned his verdict.</p>

<p>“<em>He’s safe!</em>” declared the official.</p>

<p>The breathless Pete was extricated and pulled
triumphantly to the bench while Norrisville, represented
by catcher and pitcher and shortstop, who
was also captain, gathered around the home plate
to record their displeasure at the decision. But Mr.
Cochran, physical director at the Y. M. C. A., discouraged
argument and waved them aside politely
but firmly and, while the cheering died away, Gordon
Merrick went to bat. Clayton was shaken by
that home-run and seemed absolutely unable to tell
where the plate was, although the catcher despairingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
invited him to come up and have a look at it!
Gordon smiled serenely and presently walked to
first. Captain Jones sent him to second with a nice
hit past shortstop and Clearfield got ready to acclaim
more tallies. But Scott’s best was a slow
grounder to shortstop and he made the third
out.</p>

<p>Five runs, however, was enough to win the game,
or so, at least, the delighted Clearfield supporters
declared. And so, too, thought the players themselves.
As for their coach, Dick hoped the game
was safe, but he meant to take no chances and so
when in the next inning, after his own players had
failed to add to the total, Norrisville began to show
a liking for Tom Nostrand’s delivery by getting two
safeties and putting a man on third before the side
was retired, Dick sent Tom Haley to warm up.</p>

<p>There was no more scoring by either team until
the first of the sixth. Then Haley had a bad inning.
The first Norrisville batter laid down a bunt toward
the pitcher’s box and Tom, fielding it hurriedly,
pegged it far over Merrick’s head. The runner
slid to second in safety. That mishap unsettled
Haley and he filled the bases by passing the next
two men. That Clearfield finally got out of the hole
with only two runs against her might well be considered
a piece of good fortune. In the last of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
sixth Clearfield added one more tally and the score
stood 6 to 2. Neither side scored in the seventh.</p>

<p>For my part, I’d like to lower the curtain. Clearfield
should have had that game. But it wasn’t to
be. Perhaps the home players were too certain. At
all events, errors began to crop out at the most unfortunate
times, and these, coupled with Tom
Haley’s erratic pitching, were the Purple’s undoing.
It was Captain Jones himself who booted an easy
hit that might have been a double and instead of
retiring the side in the first of the eighth, let two
more runs cross the plate. Then Haley hit a batsman,
donated a third base on balls and finally allowed
a hard-slugging Norrisville man to slap out a
two-bagger. When the worst was over the score
was tied, and so it remained throughout the
ninth inning and the tenth and the eleventh
and the twelfth. And when that was over darkness
had descended and eighteen very tired players
heard with relief the umpire call the game.
And several hundred spectators, rather stiff and
chilly and hungry, went disappointedly home to
supper.</p>

<p>“I knew mighty well,” declared Fudge as he and
Perry made their way through the twilight, “that
we could never win with <em>that</em> line-up! You heard
me tell Harry so, too, didn’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>And Perry, being a good chum, assented.</p>

<p>The next day it rained. Not enough, as Fudge
bitterly reflected, to keep a fellow from going to
church, but sufficiently to make sojourning out of
doors in the afternoon a very wet and unpleasant
business. It drizzled, but the drizzle was much
more of a rain than a mist, and when, about three
o’clock, Fudge went across town to Perry’s house
he arrived in a fairly damp condition. Being damp
affected Fudge’s naturally sunny disposition. It
didn’t make him cross, but it gave him an injured
and slightly pathetic expression and tinged his utterances
with gloom and pessimism. He wasn’t a
very cheerful companion to-day, and Perry, who
had been having a rather comfortable and cozy
time curled up on the black horse-hair lounge in
the Doctor’s reception-room—also used as a parlor
on extraordinary occasions—with a volume of Du
Chaillu’s travels which he had happened on in the
book-case, almost wished that his friend had stayed
at home. They went up to Perry’s room and sat
by the open window and watched the drizzle and
talked desultorily of track and field work and yesterday’s
game and of many other things. The affair
of the “train-robber” was, it seemed by mutual
agreement, avoided; it was not a day to inspire one
to detecting. The “train-robber’s” window was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
open across the back yard, but no one appeared at
it. Fudge had drawn the conversation back to
shot-putting and was indulging in a few well-chosen
disparaging remarks with regard to the overbearing
manner of Harry Partridge when sounds came to
them. Of course sounds had been coming to them
for half an hour; the patter of rain, the quiet footfalls
of Mrs. Hull below-stairs, the whistle of the
three-twenty-two train crossing the bridge and such
ordinary noises; but this was new and different.
Perry drew Fudge’s attention to it and then listened
puzzledly. At first it seemed to come from around
the corner of the house, but presently they located
it in the room occupied by the “train-robber.” They
crowded their heads through the window and
strained their ears.</p>

<p>“What’s he doing?” demanded Fudge in a hoarse
whisper after a minute or two.</p>

<p>“I think”—Perry hesitated—“I think he’s singing!”</p>

<p>“Singing!”</p>

<p>“Yes; listen!” They listened. Perry was right.
The sounds that issued from the window were undoubtedly
those of a man’s voice raised in song.
What the words of the song were they couldn’t make
out, but the tune, if it deserved the name, was
peculiarly slow and doleful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“Jimminy, he must be feeling bad!” muttered
Fudge.</p>

<p>“Sounds like a—a dirge, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Awful!” They tried hard to hear what it was
all about, but as the singer was evidently well back
from the window and as the window was some little
distance away, they failed. Finally they drew their
heads in, being by that time somewhat wet, and
viewed each other inquiringly. Then, without a
word, Fudge lifted his cap from the table, Perry,
equally silent, moved toward the door and the two
quietly descended the staircase. Perry got his
cap from the tree in the front hall and they slipped
through the front door, across the porch and into
the drizzle.</p>

<p>Two minutes later they were climbing the stairs
in the brick building on G Street, looking very
much like the desperate conspirators they felt themselves
to be. A pleasant odor from the bakery on
the first floor pursued them as they noiselessly
ascended the staircase and crept along the first hall.
The building was silent and apparently deserted until,
half-way up the second flight, from behind the
closed door and transom of Number 7, came the
muffled tones of a deep bass voice in monotonous,
wailing cadence. The boys paused at the head of
the stairs and listened. Words came to them, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
only occasionally. They tip-toed nearer. That was
better. They could hear fairly well now.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I wash in a pool and wipe on a sack,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">And sleep on the ground for want of a cot.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As the voices of the Sirens lured Ulysses of old,
so the doleful strains lured Perry and Fudge nearer
and nearer.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My ceiling’s the sky and my carpet’s the grass,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">My preacher’s a wolf on a pulpit of bones.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>By now the two boys were standing on either side
of the door, listening raptly.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The wails ceased. A moment’s silence ensued.
Then the door was suddenly opened, and:</p>

<p>“Come right in, pardners,” said a voice. “Everything’s
free!”</p>

<small>THE WHITE SCAR</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They were two very startled youths who
leaped back as the door unexpectedly opened
and who, for a breathless instant, gazed
speechlessly at the man confronting them. He was
tall, wide-shouldered and narrow-hipped, with a
frank, good-looking face, clean-shaven, on which
at the moment a quizzical smile rested. He had laid
aside coat and vest, and under the uprolled sleeves
of his white shirt his long arms showed muscles
like whip-cords. It was Fudge who found his
voice first.</p>

<p>“I—I—W-w-we——”</p>

<p>“No savvy, hombre. Start again.”</p>

<p>“W-we were j-j-just list-list-list——”</p>

<p>“Listening,” said Perry helpfully.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you liked it. Come on in. We’re
all friends together.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” said Perry, embarrassed. “We
just happened to hear you singing——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>“Hooray!” exclaimed the man. “That’s sure
fine! Shake, pardner!”</p>

<p>And Perry found himself shaking hands most
enthusiastically with the strange person and, at the
same time, being drawn through the doorway. He
tried to hold back, but it was utterly useless. Fudge,
his startled expression vastly increased, followed
doubtfully and the man closed the door. He was
smiling broadly.</p>

<p>“Sit down, boys, and tell me your sweet, sad
tale. You sure have made a big hit with me,
all right. No one ever called that noise of mine
singing before. Yes, sir, muchachos, you’ve won
me!”</p>

<p>“I—we thought it was very”—Perry searched
for a word—“very nice singing.”</p>

<p>“P-P-Peachy,” supplemented Fudge, smiling ingratiatingly,
and then casting a troubled look at
the closed door. To be shut in like this at the
mercy of a train-robber had not been within his
calculations. To increase his uneasiness, Fudge
noted that his host’s eyes were blue, light grayish-blue,
but still to all intents and purposes blue! He
looked meaningly at Perry, wondering whether, if
they started together, they could reach the door before
they were intercepted. The man had made
them take two of the three chairs and perched himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
on a corner of the table in the middle of the
room.</p>

<p>“I hope I didn’t scare you when I pulled the door
open,” he said. “Wouldn’t want to do that, you
know. Too flattered at having an audience.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, we weren’t scared,” Perry assured him
not too truthfully. “We oughtn’t have done it, but—we
heard you and——”</p>

<p>“Just couldn’t resist it, eh? Was it the words
or the tune that hypnotized you?” He regarded
Perry very gravely indeed, but there was a twinkle
in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>Perry smiled weakly.</p>

<p>“I—I guess it was the words,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it was! That’s a nice song. I’ll teach
it to you some time if you like. Haven’t I seen
you boys around town?”</p>

<p>Perry nodded, casting a quick glance at Fudge.
Fudge, however, had his gaze set longingly on the
door.</p>

<p>“I thought so. I’ve got a good memory for faces.
Pretty good ears, too.” He laughed. “I suppose
you fellows thought you weren’t making a sound out
there? Well, I heard you when you first came along
the hall. Live around here, do you?”</p>

<p>“I do,” answered Perry. “He doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s tell our names. Mine’s Addicks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“My name is Hull and his is Shaw. My first
name is Perry.”</p>

<p>“Perry Hull, eh? Sounds like something out of
a history of the American Navy. Any relation to
the celebrated commodores?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name to his friends?” asked the
host, nodding toward Fudge.</p>

<p>“Fud—that is, William.”</p>

<p>“My first name’s Myron. I don’t know why they
called me that, but they did. Doesn’t he ever talk?”
Again Mr. Addicks indicated the absorbed Fudge.</p>

<p>“I was j-j-just thinking,” replied the latter.</p>

<p>“Oh! What were you thinking?”</p>

<p>Fudge regarded the questioner doubtfully. “Lots
of things,” he muttered darkly.</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks laughed. “Sounds interesting, the
way you tell it! I dare say you chaps go to school?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, High School,” replied Perry. “We’re
both juniors.”</p>

<p>“Good leather! Go in for sports, do you? Football,
baseball, those things?”</p>

<p>“A little. Fudge plays baseball and football some.
I play football, too.”</p>

<p>“So his name is Fudge, is it? William Fudge
Shaw, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“It’s just a nickname,” explained Perry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>“I savvy. William week-days and Fudge Sunday,
eh?” Perry smiled politely at the joke, but
Fudge’s expression remained serious and distrustful.
“I’d like to see you fellows play some time,”
continued their host. “I used to play football at
college, but I never tried baseball. Didn’t have
time. Sprinting and hurdling were my stunts. Do
you have a track team at your school?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Perry eagerly, “and he and
I are trying for it this year. Fudge is learning to
put the shot and throw the hammer and I’m trying
the sprints.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say? How old are you, Hull?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen.”</p>

<p>“You look older. What’s your time for the hundred?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know yet. Skeet—he’s our coach—gave
me a trial the other day, but he wouldn’t tell
me what my time was.”</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks nodded. “I see. What’s the school
record?”</p>

<p>Perry didn’t know, but Fudge supplied the information.
“It’s ten and a fifth. Lanny White did
it last year against Springdale.”</p>

<p>“That’s good work! I’d like to see that chap
run. I suppose you have your work-outs in the
afternoons, don’t you? If I didn’t have to—if I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
wasn’t so busy I’d come out and look you over. My
record was ten flat for the hundred when I was
in college, and fifteen and two-fifths over the high
hurdles. I never could do much at the two-twenty
distance, sprint or hurdles. I did do the low hurdles
once in twenty-six flat, but that was in practice.”</p>

<p>“What college did you go to?” asked Fudge, forgetting
his suspicion for the moment.</p>

<p>“Morgan,” answered the man, and smiled at
their perplexity. “It’s in Nebraska. Ever hear
of it?”</p>

<p>They shook their heads, looking apologetic.</p>

<p>“I suppose not. It’s a long ride from here. Good
little college, though. I spent a right comfortable
three years there.”</p>

<p>“Does it take but three years to get through
there?” asked Fudge. “I’d like to go there myself,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“No, but I was in a hurry, so I finished up in
three. Had to get out and hustle me a living, you
see. Not but what I wasn’t doing that after a
fashion all the time.” He paused and chuckled
deeply. “Ran a livery stable.”</p>

<p>“A livery stable! While you were in college?”
asked Fudge.</p>

<p>“You said it, hombre. Had to do something.
Didn’t have much of anything but what I had on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
when I struck college. Paid them a half-year’s
tuition—education’s cheap out that way, friends,
and it’s good, too—and looked around for something
to work at. Didn’t find anything at first and
so one day I go down to a stable run by a poor
thing name of Cheeny and hires me a bronch for
a couple of hours. I can always think a heap
better when I’m on a horse, it seems. Well, thinking
doesn’t do me much good this time, though, and
I heads back to town telling myself the best thing
I can do is roll my blanket and hit the trail. But
when I gets back to the stable, which isn’t much
more than a shed and a corral built of railway ties
set on end, this poor thing name of Cheeny says
to me: ‘Know anyone wants to buy a nice livery
business?’ ‘Supposing I did?’ says I, squinting
around the shack. ‘Why, here it is,’ he says. Well,
to come right down to brass tacks, he and I did
business after a day or two. He wanted to hike
back to Missouri, which he ought never to have left,
and we made a dicker. I was to pay him so much
a month till we were square. ’Course I knew that,
as he’d been running the place, he wasn’t making
enough to pay his feed bill, but I had a notion
I could do a bit better. Did, too. What I bought
wasn’t much—half a dozen carriages about ready
to fall to pieces, five bronchos and a little grain and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
alfalfa. The bronchs weren’t so bad, if you excuse
their looks. What they needed mostly was food.
Trouble was, though, that everyone out there who
needed a horse had one, and I saw that if I was to
make anything on that investment I’d have to make
my own market. Which I did.”</p>

<p>“How did you do it?” asked Perry eagerly.</p>

<p>“Introduced the wholesome recreation of riding.
Used to take a string of bronchs up to college
in the afternoon and stand ’em outside the
Hall. Then when anyone came along I’d ask him if
he didn’t want to hire a horse for two bits an hour.
At first I just got laughed at. Then one or two
fellows tried it for a lark, and after that it went
fine. I gave riding lessons to some of the girls—Morgan
is co-ed, you know—and the next year I
had to buy me more horses. Paid that poor thing
name of Cheeny in full before I’d been there six
months. When I left I sold out to a man from
Lincoln and did right well. Now you talk.”</p>

<p>“Wh-what did you do next?” asked Fudge interestedly.</p>

<p>“Went down to Texas and got a job with a firm
of engineers who were running a new railway
down to the Gulf. I’d taken a course of civil engineering.
Met up with a slick customer who looked
like a down-east preacher and went shares with him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
on some oil land. Still got it. Something happened
to the railway about that time and they stopped
work. That left me strapped and I hired out as a
ranch hand. After that I went to punching down
near Las Topas.”</p>

<p>“Punching?” queried Fudge.</p>

<p>“Cows.”</p>

<p>“You mean you were a cowboy?” asked Perry
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Four years of it.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” sighed Perry. “That must have been
great!”</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks laughed. “Well, some of it wasn’t
so bad. I liked it pretty well. I was always crazy
about horses and riding. I got enough of it, though.
It don’t get you anything. An uncle of mine died
and a lawyer wrote me I was the old chap’s heir and
had better beat it back here and claim the estate.
Which I did.” He smiled wryly. “The estate was
a tumble-down farm-house about three miles from
here on the Springdale road with a mortgage all
over it. There’s so much mortgage you have to
lift up a corner of it before you can see the house.
Being still a trifle worse than broke, I got a job
with a moving picture company in Jersey and rode
for ’em almost a year. That was harder work than
being the real thing, and a sight more dangerous. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
nearly killed myself one day, when a horse fell
on me, and so I got my time and quit being an actor.
That was about a month ago. Then I came back
here and rented this place and started in business.
The business hasn’t shown up yet, though. I guess
being a civil engineer in Clearfield is about as busy
a job as being a street-cleaner in Venice! Now
you know all about me. Hope I haven’t tired you
out.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” replied Perry emphatically. “I
like to hear about it. Say, you’ve been around a
lot, haven’t you? Were you born in Nebraska?”</p>

<p>“Me? Hombre, I’m a native son of this grand
old state. My folks farmed it over near Petersboro
before the Pilgrims bought their passage!”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to go to college away out
there, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why—now, look here, I’ve talked enough. I’ll
tell you some day about that, if you say so, but if
I don’t quit now you’ll think I’m wound up. You
tell me things.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Perry, smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you aiming to do when you get
through cramming your head full of knowledge,
friend?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I used to think I’d be a doctor.
That’s what my father is. But lately—I don’t know.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
There doesn’t seem to be much money in doctoring.”</p>

<p>“Be a civil engineer then and get rich,” said Mr.
Addicks gravely. “What’s your line going to be,
Shaw?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to be an author,” answered Fudge
earnestly.</p>

<p>“That’s another of those well-paid professions.
Guess what we’d better do is make a date to meet
in the poor house in, say, twenty or thirty years!”</p>

<p>“Some authors make a lot of money,” said Fudge.</p>

<p>“Do they? Maybe so. The only one I ever knew
who had money in his pocket was a chap out in
Laredo. Don’t know as you’d call him an author
exactly either; more of a poet. He traveled around
on side-door Pullmans and sold poems at the houses.
Said he was ‘singing his way around the world.’
Told me he sometimes got as much as fifty cents
for a poem. Yes, he was what you might call a
right successful author; one of those ‘best-sellers’
you hear about, I guess.”</p>

<p>“What were the poems like?” asked Fudge.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe, between you and me and
the shovel, he had more than the one, and that—let
me see if I can remember it. How was it now?
‘My name is——’ I used to know that song, too.
Wait a minute. I’ve got it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘My name is James O’Reilly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">I come from Erin’s sod</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To sing my humble ballads</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">As round the world I plod.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I ask no gift from any man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">I pay my way with song.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The world is kind, and so I find</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Each day I trudge along.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“I wouldn’t call that real poetry,” said Fudge
critically.</p>

<p>“No more did he; he called it a song. Anyhow,
it brought him money. If someone doesn’t happen
in pretty quick and give me a job of surveying I’m
going to steal that song and see what I can do with
it! I suppose, now, you fellows don’t want any
surveying done? My prices are cheap. This is
bargain week.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” answered Fudge. “I guess
there isn’t much——”</p>

<p>He suddenly stopped, mouth open, eyes round
and glassy, and stared at his host.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Mr. Addicks, following
Fudge’s fascinated gaze. “Anything wrong with
my hand?”</p>

<p>Fudge seemed to shake himself out of his daze.
“N-n-n-no, sir!” he gulped. “Oh, n-n-no, sir! I
j-j-just hap-hap-happened to th-th-think of some-something!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Addicks laughed dryly. “You’re a remarkable
young thinker, Shaw. I thought, by the way
you were looking at my hand, that maybe I needed
a manicure. Hello, going?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I guess we’d better be getting home,”
said Perry. “We’ve enjoyed your—our visit.”</p>

<p>“Have you? Well, I have, anyway. I was just
naturally bored to death when you came. When
you hear me trying to sing you’ll know it’s because
I’m bored. Drop in again soon, fellows. I’m usually
in in the mornings. Come around and I’ll
teach you that song.” He chuckled as he opened
the door for them. “I know some others too. ‘Sam
Bass,’ for instance. I know thirty-four verses of
‘Sam Bass,’ and that’s three more than any other
chap at the ‘Lazy K’ knew!”</p>

<p>It was not until they were in the street that either
of the boys spoke. Then Perry asked wonderingly:
“For the love of mud, Fudge, what was the matter
with you? You looked like a dying fish!”</p>

<p>“D-d-d-didn’t you see?” asked Fudge tensely.</p>

<p>“See what?”</p>

<p>“The wh-wh-wh-white s-s-scar!”</p>

<p>“What white scar? Where?”</p>

<p>“On his arm!” replied Fudge, hoarsely, triumphantly.
“The l-l-left one!”</p>

<small>SEARS MAKES A SUGGESTION</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That Sunday evening there was an informal
meeting at Guy Felker’s house in the interests
of the Track Team. Guy had asked
a half-dozen fellows to come and talk over affairs,
and Lanny, Harry Partridge, Arthur Beaton and
Toby Sears had responded. Orson Kirke had excused
himself by telephone and Jack Toll had simply
failed to appear. Toby Sears was Senior Class
President, the School’s best broad-jumper and a
fair quarter-miler. Sears was eighteen and a rather
earnest chap on whose judgment the school always
placed the utmost reliance. It was Sears who was
talking now.</p>

<p>“What Guy has said is just about so. There
isn’t now and never has been enough interest in
track and field athletics with us. Every year it’s
been increasingly difficult to get fellows to come
out for the team. Considering the lack of material
we’ve had to contend with, I think we’ve done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
very well. But this spring a lot of us have been
hoping that things would be easier for the captain
and the coach, for we want to make this year’s victory
over Springdale decisive. But, as Guy has told
us, as things stand now the team is very one-sided.
That is, we’ve got a lot of candidates for the field
events and mighty few for the track. And here it
is the first of May and the Springdale meet is little
over a month off. Even if we found fellows now to
come out and work for track positions there is
scarcely time to develop them. And, for my part, I
doubt that we can get any. Guy made a pretty good
canvass of the school last month and I think he’s got
hold of about all the talent there is. Seems to me,
then, that the only thing to do is for us fellows to
see if we can’t come to the rescue and round out
the team better. I’ve never run a half-mile in competition
and don’t know what I could do, but I’m
willing to try. That would give me three events
but if they didn’t come too close together I guess
I could manage them. And it seems to me that
there are others who could attempt more than they
are attempting now. How about you, Harry?
You’re down for the shot and hammer, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’ll try anything once, Toby. The
trouble is that I don’t think I’m good for anything
else, and a month is short time to learn new tricks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>“Well, you know what you can do and can’t do.
Still, I think that some others of us could double
up, so to speak. We haven’t but one miler on the
team, as you know. Smith is doing his best, but
unless he travels faster than he did last year he
won’t get a point. Springdale, from what I can
learn, is especially strong this year at the mile,
half and quarter and we’ve got to get some seconds
and thirds in those events to have a chance at winning.
Presser is willing to do all he possibly can,
but he can’t turn out runners if he isn’t given material
to work on. So, as I’ve said, it seems to me
it would be a good plan to induce some of the fellows
who are trying for field events to go in for
track work. I don’t suppose it’s possible to take,
say, a chap who has never done anything but jumping
and make a good half-miler of him in a month,
but if we can make him good enough to capture a
third we’re helping our chances.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s a splendid idea,” said Captain
Felker. “Of course, there are some of us who
couldn’t take up more than we are taking. I, for
one. I’d be willing enough, but you simply can’t
run sprints or distances and do yourself justice at
the pole-vault. Besides that, the arrangement of
events interferes. But I do think there are fellows
on the team who will be willing to enter two or, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
some cases, even three events. I wish we could get
up some enthusiasm for the mile and the half-mile.
Fellows seem to hold off from those events
as if they were poison. I dare say they think they’re
harder work. In a way they are, or, at least, they
require a more sustained effort than the sprints
and hurdles. And speaking of hurdles, we need
a bigger field there. Lanny’s got all he can manage
with the sprints, although he intends to try the high
hurdles too. The only fellow we have in sight now
for the low sticks is Arthur here. We ought to
have four men for every event on the program, and
that’s the truth of it.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to try the sprints if you think it
will do any good,” said Arthur Beaton. “I might
push some Springdale fellow out in the trials, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I’d suggest,” said Partridge, “that Guy and
Skeet get together and go over the list and see what
can be done in the way you suggest, Toby. As
I said before, I’ll try anything anyone wants me
to. Anything, that is, except the pole-vault. I
don’t want to break my neck!”</p>

<p>“There are about ten fellows trying for the
sprints,” said Lanny. “We don’t need more than
half of them. Why can’t some of them be turned
into hurdlers, Guy? Any fellow who can do the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
hundred on the flat can do it over the sticks if he’s
once shown how.”</p>

<p>“Sure he can,” agreed Harry. “Call a meeting
of the candidates, Guy, and tell each one what’s
expected of him. Don’t just say, ‘Will you do this?’
but tell ’em they’ve got to! Get Toby to talk to
’em and put some pep in ’em. Make ’em understand
that we’ve got to lick Springdale next month and
that——”</p>

<p>“The trouble is,” interrupted Lanny, “that the
fellows don’t take track athletics seriously. It’s got
to be sort of the style to smile when you mention
the subject. We’ve run so to football and baseball
that we don’t think anything else is worth while.
Even the fellows who are on the team go around
with a half-apologetic grin, as much as to say, ‘I’m
on the Track Team. Isn’t it a joke?’ What ought
to be done in this school is to get track athletics
back where they belong as a major sport.”</p>

<p>“And the best way to do that,” said Sears, “is
to everlastingly wallop Springdale.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but——”</p>

<p>“I think there ought to be more incentive for
fellows to come out for the team,” said Harry
Partridge. “Of course, if a chap is fond of running
or jumping or hurdling he’s going to do it without
persuasion, but there are lots of fellows, I guess,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
who have the making of good track or field men
who don’t realize it and don’t think about it. Of
course, it’s too late this year, but next——”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this year that’s worrying me,” broke
in Guy. “Whoever comes after me can bother
about next year.”</p>

<p>“Still,” said Sears earnestly, “we’ve got to work
for the future as well as the present; or we should
anyway. I’ve sometimes wondered if we couldn’t
enlarge the interest by holding a meet about the
middle of the season, a handicap meet between
classes. Once get a fellow interested and if he has
anything in him he wants to get it out. And so
he keeps on.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good scheme,” agreed Guy. “Funny
we’ve never thought of it. But it’s too late for this
spring. What we might do, though, is to hold an
open meet and work up some enthusiasm that way.
It would be a good thing, anyway, for the team.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we get a meet with some other
school?” asked the manager. “Highland Hall or
someone.”</p>

<p>“Guy’s scheme would answer the same purpose,”
said Sears. “We could talk it up, get the candidates
themselves interested in it and get the school
interested, too. It might show us some material
we didn’t know of. Some fellows will do stunts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
in competition that they wouldn’t think of in
practice.”</p>

<p>“Ought to be prizes, I suppose,” said Lanny.
“How about it?”</p>

<p>“Ought to be, yes,” agreed Guy; “but where’d
we get them? There isn’t enough money to fix
the track up decently.”</p>

<p>“Instead of individual prizes for each event,”
offered Manager Beaton, “we might have a single
prize for the best performance, or something like
that.”</p>

<p>That was discussed and eventually abandoned.
As Guy pointed out, it would be a mighty difficult
matter to decide which was the best performance
and the awarding of the prize might lead to a lot
of dissatisfaction amongst the less fortunate contenders.
“We don’t need prizes,” he said. “We’ll
publish the names of the winners and that will
be enough.”</p>

<p>“Arthur’s idea might be used, though,” said
Sears thoughtfully, “in the Springdale meet. How
would it do to have some sort of a trophy to go
to the fellow winning the most points for us?”</p>

<p>“What sort of a trophy?” asked Lanny.</p>

<p>“Well, nothing expensive, of course. It would
be something to work for, and just now, when we
want to induce fellows to take up new stuff, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
mightn’t be a bad idea to give them something—er—tangible
to go after. Maybe just a pewter mug
would do.”</p>

<p>“Suppose two or three fellows scored the same
number of points?” asked Arthur. “That might
easily happen, mightn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it might.” Sears considered.
“Then let each have possession of the mug for a
certain time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your idea is to have the thing competed for
each year?”</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” said Lanny. “Get some of the
girls to make a stunning purple banner—no, pennant—and
give it to the fellow who does the best
work for us, as Toby suggests. In case two or
more win the same number of points, take into
consideration the fellows’ performances. If two
chaps each won, say, eight points for us, the one
who made the better record for his event would
get the flag. And then let him keep it and we’ll
find a new one for next year. Call it the Track
Trophy and have it understood that, next to the
Victoria Cross, it’s the biggest honor you can
win!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” assented Harry Partridge,
“but it strikes me that a silver or even a pewter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
mug would make more of a hit than a pennant.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” responded Lanny. “Besides,”
he added, with a smile, “that mug would cost us
money, and the pennant won’t!” The others
laughed.</p>

<p>“Still,” said Arthur Beaton, “a few of us might
dig down for it. You can get a pretty good-looking
mug for three dollars.”</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, old scout,” protested Guy.
“I’m poorer than the Athletic Committee, and that’s
pretty poor! Let’s make it a pennant. It doesn’t
matter what it is, really, so long as it is understood
that the thing’s worth winning. It could
be made of silk and have a suitable inscription on
it, like ‘For Valor’—— No, that wouldn’t do.
‘For Worth?’ ‘For——’”</p>

<p>“For Instance,” laughed Lanny. “Never mind
an inscription. Just have ‘C. H. S.’ on it.”</p>

<p>“With a winged foot,” suggested Arthur.</p>

<p>“Then if I won it throwing the hammer,” said
Harry Partridge, “it wouldn’t be what you’d call
appropriate, would it?”</p>

<p>“In a general way——” began Arthur.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it,” interrupted Lanny. “A purple silk
pennant with a green laurel wreath inclosing the
letters ‘C. H. S.’ in white. How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Sounds mighty good-looking,” replied Sears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
and the rest agreed. Guy Felker, however, was a
trifle impatient of the subject.</p>

<p>“We can find a design easy enough later,” he
said. “The question is whether it’s worth doing.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” asserted Sears, and the others
agreed.</p>

<p>“Anything that will convince the fellows that
it’s worth while trying to do all they can for the
team, is worth doing,” said Lanny decidedly. “Remember,
Guy, that you and Skeet have got to persuade
chaps to go in for stunts they’ve never tried,
in many cases.”</p>

<p>“But won’t it look,” asked Arthur, “as if we were
offering this pennant just to—to——”</p>

<p>“I get your idea,” said Lanny. “How would it
do if we kept out of it and let the girls offer it?
We might suggest it to them and let them do the
whole thing. Louise Brent would be a good one
to start it up.”</p>

<p>“That’s better,” said Guy. “We’ll keep out of
it entirely. Suppose you attend to the—the negotiations,
Lanny. You’re a popular chap with the
ladies!”</p>

<p>“Let Toby do it,” Lanny replied.</p>

<p>“It is moved and seconded that Lanny be appointed
a committee of one to negotiate with Louise
Brent in the matter of a purple silk pennant. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
those in favor will so signify by raising their right
hands. One, two, three, four. It is a vote, gentlemen.”
Toby bowed gravely to Lanny.</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed the latter. “It’s all up
when Toby’s in the chair, anyway! Any other
business before the meeting, Guy?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. We’ll see what can be done
with persuading the fellows to try new stunts.
Maybe it’ll work out fine. I hope so. Much
obliged for coming around, anyhow. I was getting
a bit discouraged, to tell the honest truth.
Skeet’s been growling for days and wanting to
know how I expected him to make a team out of
nothing. And the trouble was I couldn’t tell him!
You fellows needn’t run off so early, though.”</p>

<p>“I’m going home and pile into bed,” replied
Lanny gravely. “From now on I shall take the
very best care of myself because, you see, I mean
to get that purple pennant.”</p>

<p>“You?” jeered Harry Partridge. “You haven’t
the ghost of a show, you old tow-head! I only have
to close my eyes to see that thing hanging over
my mantel!”</p>

<p>“Huh! Open ’em again and wake up! Good-night,
all!”</p>

<small>THE SQUAD AT WORK</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On Monday work for the Track Team entrants
was no different than usual. Perry,
one of a bunch of seven or eight sprinters,
practiced starts, did two fifty-yard dashes and finally
swung through the two hundred and twenty.
There were no trials, nor were any of the number
allowed to go faster than a “hustle,” which was
Skeet’s term for a pace that was something like
a glorified jog. Lanny, who was now giving three
afternoons each week to track work, spent much
of his time coaching the rest, and to him Perry
owed his first real understanding of what might
be called the philosophy of the crouching start.
Lanny, watching Perry and two others at the mark,
stopped proceedings.</p>

<p>“Just a minute, you fellows,” he said. “Now,
look here. You, Hull, and you, Soper, have got
your holes placed wrong. Your front hole, Hull,
is too far from the mark for you. You’re losing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
distance every time. Put that front hole so that
your instep will come opposite your right knee when
you’re down, and dig your hole deeper, man; that
scratch in the ground doesn’t give you any purchase.
That’s the ticket, dig it out. Now then,
try that. Better? Hold on, though; you’re straddled
too much. The idea is that when you get
away your rear foot will travel straight forward.
Your back hole is too far to the right. Put it about
here and see how it goes. That’s the trouble with
you, too, Soper. Your back hole is too far back
and too wide of the line through your body.”</p>

<p>The two boys followed instructions and presently
tried another start. When they had run through
their dozen or fifteen yards and walked back, Lanny
began again.</p>

<p>“As near as I can tell, fellows,” he said, “neither
of you really understand why you’re doing this.
You appear to have the idea that when you start
off you have to throw your body forward. The
result is that you both go off with a jump and
you don’t get your stride until you’re eight or ten
yards away. Watch me a minute, please. You
fellows, too; you’re none of you getting off well.
Now, then, fingers back of the mark, spread enough
to carry your weight easily, but not tense; there
ought to be a little spring to them as they lift.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
Now in setting your weight goes forward on your
fingers and the <em>ball</em> of your left foot. Don’t try
to put your body over the line; only the head and
shoulders. Now, when the pistol goes off, don’t
give a jump as though you were going to play leap-frog
all the way down to the tape. Let yourself
fall forward naturally, as you’re bound to when you
lift your hands, and then run. That’s the whole
idea of that start. You’re falling forward and you
run to keep from going on your face. Bring your
rear foot forward on a straight line, raise your
body slowly—don’t jerk your shoulders up—and
get your stride in the first three or four steps at
the most. Don’t try for long steps. Take short
ones, at least at first until you learn to lengthen
them without throwing yourself off. When you’re
running the hundred yards, fellows, about fifty per
cent. of it depends on the way you get off your
mark. Races are won or lost right there. The
idea is to get away quick, <em>but</em> get your stride at
once. Now, then, watch me and see how I do it.”</p>

<p>That, thought Perry, as his gaze followed
Lanny’s bare legs twinkling down the path, simplified
the business. No one had told him that it
was the falling forward of his body that gave him
speed in getting away from the mark. He had
been, in fact, struggling against that very thing, trying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
to recover his equilibrium at the earliest possible
moment and, in that effort, making his second
step a kind of leap in the air and wrenching
his head and shoulders backward with an awkward
and often painful motion. The result had been
that for at least a half-dozen strides he had been
“running up and down.” Having once grasped the
“why and where for,” Perry found that the crouching
start was the simplest thing in the world! Not
that he mastered it that afternoon or for many
succeeding afternoons, but each time it came easier
and eventually he found that he could reach his
stride within three or four steps of the mark and
at twenty yards be running at top speed.</p>

<p>That afternoon’s work-out ended with a “hustle”
over the two-twenty, and when, slowing up from
that, Perry turned to seek Skeet and report, he
caught a glimpse of Fudge, far down the field, hopping
ludicrously on one foot with a shot poised in
upstretched hand. Perry smiled sympathetically as
the shot sped away for a scant thirty feet. Fudge,
he feared, was not making a howling success of
his athletic endeavors. There was a rumor of an
impending cut in the squad and Perry wondered
whether he and Fudge would survive it. He almost
dared to think that he would, for, excepting
Lanny and Kirke and, possibly, Soper, his work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
was as good as any so far. As for Fudge, however,
he knew that Falkland, Partridge and Brimmer
were all from six to eight feet better with the shot,
and he doubted that Skeet would retain more than
three fellows for the weight events. Having been
released by the coach, with instructions to report
a quarter of an hour earlier on the morrow, Perry
sought the dressing-room, waited his turn at the
shower, and finally dressed and went in search of
Fudge. The shot-putters were not in sight, though,
and, hesitating whether to remain and watch baseball
practice or continue his search for his chum,
he at last left the field and made his way back along
Common Street to where, in the vacant block behind
the field, the weight candidates were practicing
with the hammer.</p>

<p>Partridge was in charge, and the squad consisted
of Fudge, George Falkland and Thad Brimmer,
while four or five spectators looked on from a safe
distance behind the ring. Perry joined these and
watched Harry Partridge whirl the twelve-pound
weight and send it sailing far across the turf. None
of them was making any great effort for distance,
however, the matter of form still being the
consideration. Fudge followed Partridge, and
Perry, who had never yet seen his friend essay the
hammer-throw, was prepared to resent the snickers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
or amused comments of the watchers beside him.
But Fudge proved something of a revelation. Awkward
with the shot he undoubtedly was, and it was
much of a question whether he would ever learn
to handle that object successfully, but when it came
to throwing the hammer Fudge was another fellow.
His sturdy body turned with the swinging
weight, his arms outstretched, his feet twinkling
marvelously above the trampled ground. Then he
stopped quickly, the whirling hammer dipped, rose
and, released, arched off like a shot from a mortar,
and Fudge, recovering, pulled up with a foot
against the wooden rim.</p>

<p>“Bully!” commended Partridge warmly. “That
was all right, Fudge! And you see what I mean
about not pulling back on the release, don’t you?
That was mighty good form! Mighty good! Get
your sweater on and keep moving. All right,
George. Now see if you handle your feet better.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Falkland was so busy trying to manage
his feet correctly that he forgot the flying weight.
At all events, at the completion of the second turn
the ball of the hammer struck the ground, plowed
up a foot of the soft turf and sent Falkland head
over heels before he could let go the handle! Fortunately,
he picked himself up unhurt, and the
laughter of the audience brought only a sheepish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
grin to his face. While he regained his breath
Thad Brimmer took his turn. After that Falkland
again tried and got the weight away without misadventure,
although not to the satisfaction of Partridge.
Fudge threw again and, while the result
was not as good as that of his former performance,
did very well. Partridge explained again, and
again threw, and the practice was over.</p>

<p>“That was a peach of a throw, Fudge,” commended
Perry, as he ranged himself beside his
friend. “I didn’t know you could do it like that!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t hard,” replied Fudge carelessly, “if you
know how.” But he managed to convey by his
tone that it <em>was</em> hard and that a great deal of
credit was deserved by one William Shaw. “I guess
the time before the last I must have made a hundred
and fifty feet easy!”</p>

<p>Fudge’s estimate was somewhat too generous, but
Perry accepted it unquestionably and accorded admiration.
He waited outside while Fudge performed
his ablutions and arrayed himself in his
street attire, and then, in the wake of the baseball
players, they made their way back to town. Fudge,
plainly pleased with himself, had a good deal to
say regarding the gentle art of throwing the hammer,
and Perry listened patiently until the subject
was exhausted. Then, and by that time they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
were leaning against Fudge’s front gate in the
fragrant warmth of the May afternoon, Perry
said:</p>

<p>“Say, Fudge, I’ve been thinking.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” responded Fudge disinterestedly.</p>

<p>“About Mr. Addicks.”</p>

<p>“Anything new?” asked Fudge eagerly. “Have
you seen him?”</p>

<p>Perry shook his head. “No, but—but I’ve been
thinking.”</p>

<p>“You said that once,” complained Fudge.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe he’s so awfully bad, do
you? He was mighty nice to us the other day,
Fudge. Lots of folks would have kicked us downstairs
if they’d caught us listening outside the door
like that. And he doesn’t—doesn’t <em>look</em> bad, now
does he?”</p>

<p>“N-no.” Fudge shook his head in agreement.
“No, he doesn’t. But we know he is, and——”</p>

<p>“But we don’t know what temptation he may
have had, Fudge,” pleaded Perry. “Maybe he was
starving or—or something. Of course, it isn’t right
to rob even if you are starving, but—but it makes
it less bad, doesn’t it? And, for all we know, he
may be trying to be better and—and live it down,
eh? See what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Sure, and that may be so, too.” Fudge knit his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
brows and looked extremely wise. “Maybe he’s
repented.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think,” said the other eagerly.
“And so it seems to me we’d ought to help him
all we can, Fudge, instead of—instead of hunting
him down!”</p>

<p>“We aren’t hunting him down,” objected Fudge.</p>

<p>“We have been. If we went to the police to-day
and told all we know, they’d grab him in a minute,
wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p>Fudge kicked the fence-post and hesitated. “I
suppose so,” he replied finally. “Only, we wouldn’t
go to the police, Perry. We’d go to the express
company, because they offer the reward.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want the reward,” declared Perry
warmly. “And neither do you!”</p>

<p>Fudge looked a little bit startled. “N-no——”</p>

<p>“Taking a reward for sending him to prison
now when he’s trying to lead a decent life and—and
establish himself in business would be rotten!
The money wouldn’t bring anything but
bad luck, either. No, sir, what we’ve got to do
is stand by him and do all we can to help him,
Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, but how can we? What can we do?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, maybe we could see that
he got some work. If he’s going to stay honest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
he mustn’t be poor, because being poor is what
leads folks to commit crimes, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Playing the piano brings him money, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Not much, I guess. What we ought to do is
to see if we can’t find someone who will give him
some civil engineering to do. I—I’ll bet he’s a good
civil engineer, too!”</p>

<p>“So do I,” asserted Fudge. “I’ll bet he can engineer
all around those fellows who did that work
for Mr. Brent out there.”</p>

<p>“That’s what a civil engineer does, isn’t it?”
asked Perry. “I mean, lays out streets and bridges
and—and things.”</p>

<p>Fudge nodded. “And surveys things, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, say, I was wondering whether we
couldn’t ask Morris to ask his father to give him
a job.”</p>

<p>“Give Morris a job?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Addicks. He’s got a lot more land out
there that hasn’t been surveyed, I’ll bet. And if
Morris asked him to give some of the work to Mr.
Addicks—of course, not all of it, but some of it—I
guess he would. He’s mighty fond of Morris.”</p>

<p>Fudge considered silently. The idea struck him
as being perfectly feasible, even brilliant, but he
wished he had thought of it himself. After a moment:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
“Morris isn’t the one, though, to ask Mr.
Brent,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Who is?”</p>

<p>“Louise.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know her except to speak to, and I
wouldn’t like to ask her. You could, though,
couldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Mm, maybe. I’ve got a better scheme than
that, though, Perry. You listen. You know, Dick
and Louise are great friends, and if we went to
Dick and told him about Mr. Addicks and asked
him to ask her to ask her father——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t think we ought to tell anyone,
even Dick Lovering, about Mr. Addicks.”</p>

<p>“We don’t need to tell him <em>that</em> part of it. We’ll
just say that he’s a—a tip-top fellow, which he is,
and that he’s just come here and needs work like
anything; that he has to live in one room and
maybe doesn’t have enough to eat, and how he
worked his way through college running a livery
stable, and lost his money in oil or something, and
all that. Dick’s just the fellow to help anyone
like that. He—he just loves to help folks!”</p>

<p>“Well, if we could do it that way, without letting
out about Mr. Addicks being a train-robber,
it would be fine,” replied Perry heartily. “Shall
we, Fudge?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“Uh-huh, we’ll go around to-night and see Dick.
I’ll just bet you anything that Mr. Brent could
give him a lot of things to do if he wanted to.
And I’ll bet Mr. Addicks is the fellow to do them,
too!”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s something about him that makes
you know he’s smart,” confirmed Perry enthusiastically.
“It would be dandy if we could help him—help
him——”</p>

<p>“Get on his feet again,” supplied Fudge, whose
literary efforts had provided him with a fine collection
of phrases. “Yes, sir, and it’s great we
thought of doing it, Perry.”</p>

<p>Perry was too pleased to challenge his friend’s
use of the word “we,” and in a few minutes they
had parted, having agreed to meet at half-past seven
at the corner of Troutman and E Streets and put
the case before Dick Lovering.</p>

<small>THE OFFICER AT THE DOOR</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dick was just leaving the house when the
boys arrived there that evening, and Eli
Yale was awaiting him at the curb, but he
instantly offered to return. Since the evening
had turned cool, they went inside, seating
themselves in the little room to the right
that was at once parlor, living-room, library and
Dick’s study.</p>

<p>It was a comfortable, homelike little room, with
a big table by the front windows whereat Dick
studied and conducted his affairs, a smaller one,
in the center of the warmly-hued carpet, flanked
by two easy chairs,—one of which, a deeply tufted
leather affair, was Dick’s especial property,—a
couch covered with a gaily colored Afghan robe,
two book-cases, an old-fashioned foot-rest, more
chairs and, curled up on one of them, a fluffy
smoke-gray cat. Between the book-shelves was a
fireplace and on the marble ledge above, a brass-dialed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
ebony-cased clock ticked with dignified deliberation,
keeping perfect time with the purring of
Lady Gray. On the big table a green-shaded student
lamp threw a pleasant light over the neat piles
of books and papers. There was little that was
either new or expensive in the room, but everything,
from the oldest side-chair to the few pictures
on the walls, proclaimed friendliness and
comfort.</p>

<p>Fudge was the spokesman, and he managed to
tell his story with commendable brevity, although
he could not help embroidering it with a few harmless
frills. Dick was interested at once. If he
suspected that he was not being told quite all there
was to tell, he made no sign. When Fudge had
reached a slightly breathless but triumphant conclusion
Dick nodded. “I’ll be glad to speak to
Louise,” he said, “and to the others as well. I
don’t believe that Mr. Brent is employing any surveyors
just now, for I think he has done all he
is going to do on the addition at present. There’s
talk of re-locating the trolley line that runs over
to Sterling and I believe he is not going to do
anything more until that has been settled. But
we’ll do what we can, Fudge, the lot of us. If
it’s as bad as you say with this chap, he ought to
have some work given him. Do you suppose he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
can do anything else if there’s no engineering just
now?”</p>

<p>“He can run a livery stable,” said Fudge doubtfully.</p>

<p>“And punch cattle,” added Perry.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there isn’t much chance of his getting
a job at cattle-punching in Clearfield,” Dick
laughed. “All right, fellows, I’ll speak about it
this evening. I was just going to run over to the
Brents’ when you came. Look me up to-morrow
and I’ll tell you what the result is.”</p>

<p>They took their departure, highly satisfied, and
Dick sped away in Eli. When he reached Brentwood
he found Louise and Lanny in absorbed discussion
of the Track Trophy. Louise Brent was
a tall, blue-eyed girl of fifteen, with a fair skin and
much yellow-brown hair. She was attractive more
on account of her expression than her features.
Dick was made welcome and Lanny explained about
the trophy, and the three laid plans and drew
sketches for the better part of an hour. Louise
was enthusiastic and promised to interest the other
girls at once. “You just wait, Lanny,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be the most scrumptious pennant
you ever saw. We’ll get Lila Abbey to do the laurel
wreath part. She’s perfectly wonderful at that
sort of thing. Oughtn’t we to put it on a stick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose so. And tie it with purple ribbons,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Of course.” Louise reflected, tapping a pencil
against her white teeth. “It isn’t going to be awfully
easy, but we’ll do it all right. When ought
we to have it done?”</p>

<p>“Why, I guess there’s no hurry. Any time before
the Springdale meet will do, I think.”</p>

<p>“Better have it on exhibition a week or so in one
of the windows down town,” suggested Dick.</p>

<p>“We can have it done in two weeks, I’m certain,”
said Louise. “I’ll get a whole lot of the
girls around here some afternoon and we’ll work
on it. And—and it’s supposed to be our idea entirely,
you say, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we thought it would be better like that.
You needn’t tell the others that we know anything
about it. Just sort of give them to understand
that it’s your idea and that Guy and the rest of
us are tickled to death with it.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to pretend I thought of it,”
replied Louise, “because, of course, I didn’t, but I
don’t suppose anyone will ask who did think of it.
What we ought to do, first of all, I guess, is to
make a pattern of it so as to get it just the right
size.”</p>

<p>“Ought to have a drawing made, I’d say,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
Dick, “so you’ll know just where the lettering
goes and all that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, you’re just trying to make it harder!”
sighed Louise. “You’re quite right, though; only
I’m sure I don’t know who could do it. I know
I couldn’t. Could you, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, no! I can’t draw a straight line.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll find someone,” said Dick reassuringly.
“Or,” struck by a sudden thought, “I’ll tell
you what, Louise. There’s a chap here in town,
a civil engineer named Addicks, who would probably
be glad to make a drawing of the thing. I
was going to speak to you about him later. He’s
out of work and having rather a hard time of it.
Fudge and Perry Hull came to see me this evening
just before I left the house and told me about
him. The two kids were quite excited; wanted me
to see you and ask you to try and get your father
to give him some work. Philanthropy’s rather a
new stunt for Fudge, but he made out a bully case
for the chap; got me all wrought up about him!
Fudge says he has a room in that block where Ginter’s
Bakery is and cooks his own meals there and
is frightfully hard up.”</p>

<p>“The poor man!” said Louise.</p>

<p>“Yes, according to Fudge, he lives on sausages
and bread and coffee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“Sausages aren’t bad,” said Lanny judicially.
“Getting a bit late for them, though. If I were he,
I’d switch to lamb chops.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be horrid,” said Louise. “Of course I’ll
ask papa, Dick. And I’ll just insist on his finding
something for the poor man to do. I dare say
papa knows the railroad people well enough to get
them to give him work.”</p>

<p>“The railroad people?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Yes, you said he was an engineer, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Civil engineer, not railway, Louise.”</p>

<p>“Oh! That’s different, isn’t it? Civil engineers
survey things, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Correct,” replied Lanny. “Have you forgotten
the famous poem written by a civil engineer?
Something about ‘I’m monarch of all I survey; My
right there is none to dispute’; remember?”</p>

<p>“That was Cowper,” replied Louise scathingly.
“And he was a poet, not a civil engineer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right! Of the two I’d rather be the
engineer, though, and live on sausages.”</p>

<p>“Lanny, you’re crazy in the head,” laughed
Dick.</p>

<p>“He’s just silly,” corrected Louise. “Papa has a
good deal of surveying done, I think, Dick, and
I’m sure he could find some for this Mister——”</p>

<p>“Addicks is the name,” prompted Dick. “I wish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
you’d ask him, anyway. I suppose he isn’t in
this evening?”</p>

<p>“No, he and mamma went out to make a call.
Maybe he will be back before you go, though.”</p>

<p>“Does he usually stay out until midnight?” said
Lanny innocently. Louise blushed a little.</p>

<p>“You’re quite horrid this evening,” she charged.
“If you want me to make that pennant for you,
you’d better behave yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do the nicest thing I know,” returned Lanny
sweetly. “I’ll go home!”</p>

<p>The next afternoon Clearfield played Fernwood
High School on the diamond and beat the visiting
nine decisively, 14 to 3. The work of the purple
team was rather ragged and neither Haley nor
Nostrand, both of whom pitched that afternoon,
was in good form. Hits were frequent on both
sides, but Clearfield’s performance in the field prevented
many runs by the visitors. Fernwood, on
the other hand, had two bad innings, during which
their infield threw the ball wild, and errors, coupled
with some timely hitting by Bryan, Cotner
and Merrick, in especial, enabled the home team
to pile up a safe score before the game was half
over. As Lanny was working with the track men
that afternoon, his place was taken by Terry Carson,
and the substitute caught a nearly perfect game<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
until the eighth inning when a foul tip glanced
away from a bat and split one of his fingers. After
that McCoy went behind the plate, and it was a
marvel that the visitors didn’t pull the game out
of the fire, for Sprague McCoy, an outfielder, was
quite at sea in the backstop position. Nostrand,
however, who was in the points during the last
four innings, got himself together and managed to
stave off two batting rallies. The incident opened
Dick’s eyes to the fact that a second substitute
catcher was needed, and he and Captain Jones went
a-hunting. It was Pete Robey upon whom their
choice finally fell, and Pete found himself suddenly
elevated from an insecure position amongst the rabble
to a seat on the first team bench. But that was
a day or two later. To-day Dick and Warner Jones
were still discussing the matter when they left the
field, and it was into that discussion that Fudge
broke when he and Perry caught up with the older
boys just as Dick swung himself into the runabout.</p>

<p>“Dick, did you find out anything last night?”
asked Fudge eagerly.</p>

<p>“Hello, Fudge! Hello, Perry! Why, yes, something.
Pile in here and I’ll tell you in a minute.
Let Perry sit in your lap, Warner, will you?
Fudge, you squat on the floor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t drag your feet, though,” warned the captain
humorously, “or you’ll stop the car.” He and
Dick resumed their discussion of the catcher question
and kept it up until Warner got out at his
gate. When they trundled on Dick turned to the
expectant Fudge.</p>

<p>“I spoke to Louise last night, Fudge, about your
friend, and then she spoke to her father this morning.
I suspect that he didn’t much want to hire
What’s-his-name, but Louise is a very determined
person and she finally got him to say that if this
friend of yours would call on him at his office to-morrow
morning—he’s in New York to-day—he’d
talk with him. Louise telephoned me at breakfast
about it. She said Mr. Brent was very obstinate
at first.”</p>

<p>“That’s b-b-bully!” exclaimed Fudge.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t expect too much,” warned Dick.
“Mr. Brent isn’t likely to hire him unless he can
prove that he knows his business. I know enough
about Mr. Brent to be certain of that, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Sure, but he does know his business! He’s a
very fine civil engineer.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Dick gravely. “Has
he ever done any work for you?”</p>

<p>Perry chuckled, and Fudge reddened a bit. “No,
but—but you can t-t-t-tell he is, Dick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>“I see. Well, do you think he can draw?”</p>

<p>Fudge looked doubtfully at Perry, found no help
there and replied sturdily: “You bet he can! He’s
a great drawer, he is!”</p>

<p>Dick smiled as he slowed down at Perry’s gate.
“I asked because the girls are going to make a silk
pennant as a prize for the Track Team and they
want someone to make a drawing of it to work
by. I told Louise that perhaps this fellow Addicks
could do it for them. Do you think he
could?”</p>

<p>“I know he could,” answered Fudge, with beautiful
faith. “What’s it for, this pennant?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s to go, I believe, to the fellow who does
the best work for us in the meet with Springdale.
It’s to be rather a gorgeous affair; purple silk with
green leaves and white lettering. Suppose you see
Mr. Addicks and tell him about it and ask if he
will do it. There isn’t much money in it, because
the girls have got to go to quite a little expense
before they’re through, I guess. Louise thought
a dollar would be enough, but you could ask him
what he’d do it for. If it wasn’t much more than
that, I guess they’d pay it. Mind doing that?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! We’ll do it right now. It’s just
around the corner. Want to come along?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, no, I’ve got to get home. Call me up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
this evening and tell me what he says. Much
obliged, and I hope that job will pan out, fellows.
Good-night!”</p>

<p>It was getting dark in the building when Fudge
and Perry went in and climbed the stairs. Halfway
up they encountered some of the workers in
the glove factory, but after that the building seemed
deserted. At the top of the last flight, though, they
discovered that it wasn’t, for, in front of Mr. Addicks’
door at the end of the twilit corridor a bulky
figure stood. As the boys looked the figure took
on the appearance of a policeman. The policeman—they
could see him more plainly now that their eyes
had accustomed themselves to the half darkness—rapped
loudly, imperatively on the door. He
waited, and, as there was no response, he tried the
handle. The door was locked. Then he bent close
to the sign, as though making certain he was not
mistaken, glanced up at the closed transom and
swung around. Fudge dragged Perry forward and
began an examination of the signs on the nearer
portals as the policeman, walking almost noiselessly
on rubber-soled shoes, passed them with a brief
but searching glance. As his quiet footfalls died
away in the hall below Fudge turned a wild,
alarmed gaze on Perry.</p>

<p>“<em>They’re after him!</em>” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<small>THE TRAIN-ROBBER IS WARNED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Mr. Myron Addicks returned home
rather later than usual that afternoon. Although
he had knocked about the world a
good deal during his twenty-seven years, and had
put up with a good many discomforts, he had been
telling himself of late that his present domicile was
about as dreary and unsatisfactory as any he had
ever endured. The best thing he could say of it
was that the rent was cheap, cheaper than that of
any other room he had been able to find in Clearfield.
But there was little else to be said in its
favor. There was no view to be enjoyed, the building
was silent and lonely after dark—save in the
basement, from whence a strong odor of baking
arose every night—and a bath was almost an impossibility.
Unfortunately, until his income had at
least doubled itself, he could not afford to pay more,
and this afternoon, tramping along a country road
outside of town, he had reached the conclusion that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
any increase in his income was not to be expected
and that the best thing he could do was to hit the
trail back West. In short, he was rather discouraged
to-day, a condition of mind very unusual
with him, and when he entered the building
to climb the two flights to his cheerless “home”
he had just about determined to pack his battered
trunk.</p>

<p>He stopped, as was his custom, to apply a match
to the single gas-jet at the top of the first flight,
and repeated the operation in the hall above. And
having turned the key to his liking he heard his
name spoken and looked into the anxious faces of
Fudge and Perry.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he greeted them. “What are you fellows
doing up here?”</p>

<p>His tone lacked warmth, but the boys didn’t notice
the fact.</p>

<p>“We came to see you about something,” replied
Fudge, in lowered voice. And then he glanced apprehensively
toward the stairs. “Do you mind if
we go in your room, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, no; glad to have you.” Mr. Addicks produced
his key and opened his door. “Wait till I
light up or you’ll break your necks in here. Mighty
nice of you boys to call.” The gas shed light on
the rather bare room and Mr. Addicks nodded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
at the chairs. “Sit down and confess all,” he
went on. “How’s the world been treating you
two?”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” answered Fudge hurriedly. “But
that isn’t it. What we want to tell you is that—that
they’re after you, sir.”</p>

<p>“After me?” asked the other mildly. “Who
is?”</p>

<p>“The—the police, sir.” Fudge continued breathlessly.
“We came up about a half-hour ago and
he didn’t hear us, I guess, and he knocked and then
he tried the door. We made believe——”</p>

<p>“Whoa! Back up! Let’s have this right, Shaw.
You came up here to see me a half-hour ago and
saw someone knock on my door and try to open
it. Who was he?”</p>

<p>“A policeman, Mr. Addicks; a big, fat policeman.
We made believe we were looking for another
room and he went out again and we stayed
here to warn you.”</p>

<p>“Why, now that was kind of you,” replied Mr.
Addicks gravely. “But just why did you think I
ought to be warned?”</p>

<p>Fudge hesitated. After all, it was not a pleasant
task to inform a man that you knew him to
be a criminal. Perry moved uneasily in his chair,
but failed to come to his chum’s assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>“Come on,” persisted Mr. Addicks. “We’re all
friends together. What’s the idea, Shaw?”</p>

<p>Fudge threw a final appealing glance at Perry
and plunged: “It’s none of our business, sir, only
I—er—I happened to see the notice in the express
office and——”</p>

<p>“What notice?”</p>

<p>“About the train-robber. And then we—we came
in the other day and couldn’t help seeing the scar
and—and knowing.”</p>

<p>“What scar, Shaw?”</p>

<p>“On your arm, sir; the white scar just like the
description says.”</p>

<p>“The white—— Oh!” Mr. Addicks nodded
comprehendingly.</p>

<p>“We haven’t breathed a word to anyone, Mr.
Addicks, but I guess they got on to you. And we
thought you ought to know.”</p>

<p>“Of course.” Mr. Addicks’ countenance held
puzzlement and some amusement, and he was silent
a moment. At last: “Let’s have this just right
now,” he said. “You suspect me of being this train-robber
and you think the police are after me. Is
that it?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“The description of the robber fits me, does it?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir, all except the height. I guess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
you’re more than five feet and ten inches, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Five feet, eleven. But that’s near enough.
What was the fellow’s name, by the way?”</p>

<p>“He had two or three names. Edward Hurley
was one of them, and another was Crowell, and—I
don’t remember the other.”</p>

<p>“Fenney,” supplied Perry subduedly.</p>

<p>“Ha!” Mr. Addicks arose from the table on
which he had been seated, thrust his hands into his
pockets and walked to the window. The boys exchanged
expressive glances. After a moment’s
silent contemplation of the twilit world outside
Mr. Addicks turned back.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose they found out?” he asked,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>Fudge shook his head. “Maybe you left off your
disguise some time, sir.”</p>

<p>“My—my what?”</p>

<p>“Disguise; the mustache, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, the mustache. That’s it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you didn’t have it on when you came
in just now, you know.”</p>

<p>“Careless!” sighed Mr. Addicks. “No wonder
they spotted me. Well, what must be must be,
boys!” He sank into a chair with a gesture of
surrender. “I guess it’s all up, hombres.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>“Couldn’t you—couldn’t you make your getaway?”
asked Fudge, lowering his voice and glancing
apprehensively toward the door. Mr. Addicks
laid finger to lips, tiptoed across and suddenly threw
the door open. Thrilled, Fudge and Perry leaned
forward to look. The corridor, however, was
empty.</p>

<p>Leaving the door slightly ajar, Mr. Addicks returned
to his seat.</p>

<p>“You mean,” he asked, “that I might get away
before they came back for me?”</p>

<p>Fudge nodded.</p>

<p>“I wonder! You’re certain you haven’t told anyone,
Shaw? Or you, Hull?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, we haven’t,” replied Fudge emphatically,
even indignantly. “We haven’t said a word
to anyone. We—we thought at first you were a
safe-breaker,” he added apologetically.</p>

<p>“What made you think that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. Of course, we knew you
weren’t just an ordinary thief, sir; we could see
that; and so I—we thought maybe that was your
line.”</p>

<p>“You wronged me there,” said Mr. Addicks, in
hurt tones. “I’ve never cracked a safe in my life
Shaw.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sir. Only—how did you get the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
money from the express car at Cartwright? Didn’t
you have to break the safe open?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that? Why, you see—but, look here, what
made you first suspect me?”</p>

<p>“I guess it was the disguise. Besides, we knew
you were playing the piano at the theater just for
a—for a bluff.”</p>

<p>“So you knew that, eh?” muttered Mr. Addicks.
He viewed Fudge with admiration. “It’s a good
thing you’re not on the police force, Shaw, or I’d
have been nabbed long ago. You’re a regular
Burns!”</p>

<p>Fudge strove to disguise his delight in the praise,
and Perry broke into the conversation anxiously.
“Don’t you think you’d ought to be going, sir?”
he asked. “They may come back any moment.”</p>

<p>“You’re right.” Mr. Addicks referred to a tin
alarm clock on the table. “Ten after six,” he muttered.
“It’s a desperate chance, but I’ll take it.”
He disappeared into the closet and returned with
a much-worn valise which he placed, open, on a
chair. “Now then, let’s see.” He glanced frowningly
about the room. “I can’t take much with me.
I guess I’d better foot it to the next town and jump
the train there. Maybe they won’t be looking for
me. Boys, I don’t want to drive you away, but
if they should come and find you here they might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
suspect you of tipping me off. I wouldn’t want
you to get into trouble on my account, and it might
go hard with you if they found it out. Better get
out while there’s time.”</p>

<p>Fudge looked uneasy. “Well, maybe we had,”
he murmured. “They might put us through the
third degree and make us tell.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what they’d do,” said Mr. Addicks
convincedly. “I’m mighty grateful to you fellows,
and if the thanks of a train-robber are of any value
to you——”</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp220">“<em>Whats that?</em>” asked Perry, startled.</a> With a
swift leap Mr. Addicks reached the gaslight and
turned it out. In the darkness they listened with
straining ears. No sound reached them, however,
beyond the usual noises from the street. “I
thought,” muttered Perry apologetically, “I heard
something.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp220">
  <img src="images/i_fp220.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_220">“‘What’s that?’ asked Perry, startled”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“I g-g-guess,” said Fudge, as Mr. Addicks lighted
the gas again, “I g-g-guess we’d better go.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” whispered Mr. Addicks, “don’t run any
risks. Good-by, boys. Take care of yourselves
and, whatever you do, remain honest.” He shook
hands with Fudge and then with Perry. “Remember
that honesty is the best policy and take it from
me that there’s nothing in train robbery. A fellow
hasn’t got a fair chance nowadays.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>“Couldn’t you—if they don’t get you this time,
sir, couldn’t you—” Perry faltered embarrassedly—“couldn’t
you reform, sir?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try, Hull, I swear to you I’ll try.” Mr.
Addicks seemed quite affected and, after the door
had closed behind them, they thought they heard
a sob. They stole noiselessly down the stairs. On
the sidewalk Fudge drew a deep breath of relief
as he glanced left and right and saw no policeman.</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope he gets away,” he whispered
huskily.</p>

<p>Perry nodded. “So do I. He—he’s a mighty
nice fellow. What do you say if we stay around
until he goes, Fudge? I’d like to be sure he gets
away, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it wouldn’t be safe. They might—might
connect us with his escape. Why, even now
they may be watching the building! Come on, but
don’t walk too fast. Try to look careless, Perry.”</p>

<p>So, looking careless, they reached the corner, but
there, to Perry’s surprise, Fudge seized him by
the arm and dragged him on. “We’ve got to throw
them off the track,” he muttered. “They may follow
us.”</p>

<p>Silently they proceeded another block and then,
when Fudge had turned quickly and glanced back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
along G Street, they slipped around the corner,
cut through a yard and climbed a fence, dodged
past a house and finally gained Troutman
Street.</p>

<p>“There,” said Fudge, with satisfaction, “I guess
we’ve thrown them off all right.” He stopped a
moment, made a silent investigation and added
darkly: “I hope they tear their pants on that fence
the way I did!”</p>

<p>“It must be awfully late,” said Perry. “I guess
I’ll go back this way; it’s shorter.”</p>

<p>“Better not,” warned Fudge. “Come on to F
Street. They might see you.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” mused Perry as they went on down
the block, “I hope he will try to reform, Fudge.
He doesn’t seem what you’d call a hardened criminal,
does he?”</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t. I guess there’s a lot of good in
him, Perry. I dare say he will get away safely
and go back out West and settle down just like
you or me.”</p>

<p>“I do hope so.” Perry sighed. “I liked him a
lot, Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Me, too. I wish he wasn’t a criminal, that’s
what I wish. And, oh, shucks, now he can’t do
that drawing! I’ll have to tell Dick that he left
town unexpectedly. Say, let’s do something to-night,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
Perry. Think your folks’ll let you go to
the movies?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask them. I ought to study, but—but I
guess I’m too excited.” Perry laughed softly.
“Say, a fellow doesn’t save a train-robber from
the police every day, does he?”</p>

<p>“I guess not! I guess if the fellows knew what
we’d been up to to-day they’d open their eyes!”</p>

<p>“I suppose, though, we oughtn’t to tell them.”</p>

<p>“Hm, well, not for a long while,” answered
Fudge.</p>

<p>As Fudge had remained away from the theater
for some time, his mother, after extracting a promise
to get up early and study his lessons before
breakfast, at last consented to let him go, and
Fudge was leaning over Perry’s fence promptly
at twenty minutes to eight and whistling his doleful
signal. Perry joined him without his cap and spoke
subduedly.</p>

<p>“Will you wait a few minutes, Fudge?” he asked
apologetically. “Dad and mother are going with
us. Do you mind very much?”</p>

<p>Fudge kicked the base-board of the fence, a reckless
thing to do considering the condition of it, and
finally replied with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm:
“Of course not—much. What they going for,
Perry? I didn’t know they <em>ever</em> went.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“They don’t. Only dad took it into his head that
he’d like to see what the movies are like, and ma
said she’d go, too. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Well—” Fudge stopped and then asked
hopefully: “Do you think they’ll pay for me,
Perry?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” was the doubtful answer. Further
conversation across the fence was prevented by a
summons for Perry, and a minute or two later the
quartette was on its way to the theater. To Fudge’s
satisfaction, Doctor Hull, directed by Perry, attended
to the trifling matter of tickets and they
filed in. The slight delay had allowed the front
half of the house to fill and they were obliged to
seat themselves fifteen rows back, a location not
at all to Fudge’s liking. Fudge derived great enjoyment,
in the interims between films, from observing
the orchestra, and from back here all he
could see well was just the man at the piano, and
the man at the piano was the least interesting——</p>

<p>“Why, Fudge Shaw, what <em>is</em> the matter?” exclaimed
Mrs. Hull.</p>

<p>“N-n-nothing, ma’am,” replied Fudge chokingly.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you well?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes’m.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look it. You sure you don’t feel
faint?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“No’m—yes’m, I mean. I—I just had a twinge.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hull viewed him doubtfully and a trifle
disapprovingly and turned to the Doctor to confide
her belief that Fudge was by no means a satisfactory
companion for Perry. Whereupon Fudge
dug his elbow painfully into Perry’s ribs and whispered
excitedly:</p>

<p>“Perry, look down there!”</p>

<p>“Where? What?” demanded the other, squirming
out of the way of Fudge’s energetic elbow.
“What is it?”</p>

<p>“The man at the piano! Look at him!”</p>

<p>Perry looked and gasped and looked again.
Surely that back and those shoulders and that head
belonged to——</p>

<p>At that instant the piano player turned to speak
to the violinist and the boys gazed, astounded, on
the false mustache and smiling countenance of Mr.
Addicks, the train-robber!</p>

<small>MR. ADDICKS EXPLAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Fudge and Perry gazed spellbound.</p>

<p>There was no chance of mistake, even at
that distance. Before them, smiling, unconcerned,
sat Mr. Myron Addicks, one hand resting
negligently on his hip, the other on the keyboard of
the piano. No one would ever have suspected him
of being a fugitive from justice! Presently, quite
as though he had nothing to fear nor an enemy in
the world, he turned and looked calmly over the
audience. Fudge’s gasp was painful in its intensity,
and Mrs. Hull’s thoughts sped to peppermint
tea. Then the lights went down, the orchestra
broke into tuneful melody and the entertainment
began.</p>

<p>But all through the performance the two boys
shivered whenever a footstep came creaking along
the aisle or there was a sudden stir behind them.
They had visions of the entire Clearfield Police
Force, led by the stout and intrepid Chief, filing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
down the passage-way and clapping the hand of the
Law on the shoulder of the cowboy-pianist. That
the performance came finally to an end without anything
of the sort happening was almost unbelievable.
The boys accompanied the Doctor and Mrs.
Hull home, talking in excited whispers all the way
but reaching no satisfactory conclusions regarding
Mr. Addicks’ strange actions. The Doctor, who
had been innocently surprised and delighted with
his first experience of moving pictures, frequently
interrupted their conversation with questions and
reminiscences and they reached the gate before
they realized it. Perry’s request to be allowed to
walk half-way home with Fudge was firmly denied
and the latter took his departure with a last
whispered: “I’ll be around at seven, Perry. Be
ready!”</p>

<p>What was to happen at seven in the morning,
what he was to be ready for, Perry didn’t know,
but the mysterious command added further interest
to an already absorbing state of affairs and
Perry presently went to bed to participate in the
wildest and weirdest adventures that ever befell
a sleeping youth!</p>

<p>He was up at a little after six, dressed by half-past
and waiting on the front porch in a patch
of sunlight. Fudge, in spite of his good intentions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
was late and it was almost a quarter past
seven when he appeared hurrying down the
street. Perry joined him on the sidewalk and
Fudge, linking arms, conducted him around the
corner.</p>

<p>“We’re going to see him,” he said determinedly.
“If he hasn’t gone already maybe he can get away
before they look for him.”</p>

<p>He hadn’t gone. Fudge’s peremptory knock
was followed by the sudden opening of the door
and the vision of a surprised and pajama-clad Mr.
Addicks confronting them. Fudge allowed no
time for questions. He pushed past the puzzled
train-robber, followed by Perry, and motioned the
door shut. There was no evidence of hurried
flight in view. The room looked quite as usual.
The screen had been removed, revealing a tumbled
cot-bed evidently very recently occupied, and on
a one-burner stove, connected with the gas bracket
by a tube, stood a sauce-pan of water which was
already bubbling about the edges. Other indications
of breakfast were there; two eggs and a tiny
coffee canister and a half loaf of bread adorning a
corner of the table. Fudge’s voice was almost stern
as he confronted Mr. Addicks.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you beat it?” he demanded in a
hoarse whisper. “Do you <em>want</em> to get pinched?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Addicks politely controlled a yawn and
viewed Fudge with puzzlement. Then he scratched
his head, picked up a tattered dressing-gown and
slipped into it and, seating himself on the bed,
thrust his hands into the pockets of the robe and
spoke.</p>

<p>“Look here, boys, what is this?” he asked plaintively.
“I’m an awful poor performer before breakfast.”</p>

<p>“But—but you said you were going last night!”
said Fudge accusingly. “And we saw you playing
the piano at the theater! Why, they might have
nabbed you any minute!”</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks shook his head. “I was disguised,”
he replied.</p>

<p>“That’s no disguise,” said Fudge contemptuously.
“You’re taking awful chances, sir.
Couldn’t you get away now before they start to
look for you?”</p>

<p>“Before I’ve had my breakfast?” demanded the
man weakly.</p>

<p>“Well, wouldn’t you rather go without breakfast
than have it in jail?” inquired Fudge impatiently.
“If you start right now you might get
the seven-forty train. I don’t believe they’d be
watching the station so early, sir!”</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks’ expression became gravely curious.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
“Now, look here, hombres,” he said, “this
is just play, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Play!” gasped Fudge. “What do you mean,
play?”</p>

<p>“Why, this police business, of course. I mean,
you don’t really believe that I’m that train-robber
hero of yours, do you?”</p>

<p>Fudge’s jaw dropped and he stared blankly.
Finally: “Do you m-m-mean that—that you
aren’t?” he asked in a small voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks shrugged. “Naturally I mean that,
Shaw. I thought yesterday that you fellows were
playing a game and I entered into it for the fun
of it. But when you burst in at half-past seven
in the morning and want me to leave town
without any breakfast—well, I quit. You’ll
have to find someone else for the part, old
chap!”</p>

<p>“And you’re not the train-robber?” gasped
Fudge.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I never robbed a train in my
life. Sorry to disappoint you, but—well, there
it is!”</p>

<p>“Then—then w-w-what have you done?” Fudge
demanded.</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” laughed Mr. Addicks. “Shaw,
you’ll have to reconstruct your ideas of me. I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
not the man you want at all. I never robbed a
train or cracked a safe or even snatched a purse.
I’m just an unromantic sort of a dub with no
criminal record at all.”</p>

<p>“I just knew it,” murmured Perry, relieved.</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks glanced at him and smiled.
“Thanks for your good opinion, Hull,” he said.
“Now, fellows, let’s thresh this out. How did you
get it into your head I was the train-robber,
Shaw?”</p>

<p>Fudge, still mazed and a bit incoherent, did his
best to explain. He told the story from the start,
acknowledging that for a while he had only half-pretended
to believe in the theory of Mr. Addicks’
criminality, but owning that the notice in the express
office, coupled with blue eyes and a scar
on the left fore-arm, had ultimately convinced him.
Several times during his recital Mr. Addicks
chuckled amusedly, and when Fudge had reached
a somewhat lame finish he pulled back the sleeves
of his dressing-gown and pajama jacket.</p>

<p>“What sort of a scar was it?” he asked gravely.</p>

<p>“It—it was a white scar about two inches long,
sir,” stammered Fudge.</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks held out his arm for inspection.
“Have a look,” he said. Perry and Fudge looked.
Then Fudge turned the arm over. Then he lifted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
surprised eyes to Mr. Addicks. “It m-m-m-must
have b-b-been the other one!” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks obligingly bared the right arm.
Neither one showed any sign of a scar! Fudge
was plainly dazed.</p>

<p>“B-b-but I s-s-s-saw it!” he muttered. Mr. Addicks
laughed.</p>

<p>“So did I, and it must have been the day you
were here that first time. I upset the tooth-powder
that morning—my toilet accommodations are a
bit sketchy, you see—and got some on my arm.
I found it there that night. I guess that was the
scar you saw, my friend.”</p>

<p>Fudge gazed helplessly from Perry to Mr. Addicks
and back to Perry. His expression was too
ludicrous for Perry to view with a straight face
and suddenly the latter burst into a laugh. Mr.
Addicks joined him. Finally Fudge followed suit,
although a bit sheepishly. And when the merriment
was subsiding he pointed an accusing finger
toward the table.</p>

<p>“How about th-th-that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“That” was a luxuriant brown false mustache
lying on the table.</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, the ‘disguise,’” chuckled Mr. Addicks.
“Well, I’ll tell you. That <em>did</em> look bad,
I guess. You see, I was pretty nearly broke when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
I struck this place and found that my inheritance
was nothing more than a full-grown, man-size
mortgage. So I looked around for something to
do until I could get a start at surveying. I couldn’t
find anything until I happened on an advertisement
in the paper for a pianist at the theater. Well,
playing in a theater orchestra didn’t seem to me
to be just what you’d expect a civil engineer to do.
I thought that perhaps if people knew I did that
they wouldn’t consider me much good as a surveyor.
So I concluded I’d wear that mustache
as a sort of disguise. I had a lot of trouble with
it at first. Got to the stage door one day without
it and had to go back for it. And once it
dropped off on the piano keys, but no one noticed
it, fortunately. This leading a double life is trying,
fellows!”</p>

<p>At that moment the sauce-pan on the little stove
began to boil over and Mr. Addicks jumped up
and rescued it.</p>

<p>“We’d better be going along, I guess,” said
Perry. “You haven’t had your breakfast, and
neither have we.”</p>

<p>“I’d ask you to have some with me, only, as a
matter of fact, my larder is pretty empty this
morning. Tell you what, fellows, drop around
after the theater this afternoon and we’ll go on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
with the trial. Now that I’ve started, I’d really
like to convince you that I’m a respectable member
of society.”</p>

<p>“We believe it already,” replied Perry, with a
grin.</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Fudge. But his tone held deep
disappointment, and Mr. Addicks, noting it,
laughed.</p>

<p>“Shaw, you almost make me wish I really was
a train-robber or something desperate!” he said.
“I suppose you’ll never take any more interest in
me after this.”</p>

<p>Fudge smiled, a trifle embarrassed.</p>

<p>“And,” continued Mr. Addicks, “I can’t much
blame you. That reward sounded pretty good, I’ll
warrant!”</p>

<p>“R-r-reward!” blurted Fudge. “Gee, you don’t
suppose we were looking for that reward when
we came here and warned you s-s-s-so you could
get away!”</p>

<p>“That’s true, Shaw. I beg your pardon. You
acted like a good pal there, and I thank you. You
too, Hull. You both of you acted white. By the
way, is everything quite cleared up? Any little
things you’d like explained?”</p>

<p>“N-no, sir, I guess not,” replied Fudge. “Still
about that policeman——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Lafferty? Well, Lafferty’s rather a friend
of mine and sometimes drops in for a smoke.
That’s all.” Mr. Addicks chuckled. “Lafferty
would be interested if he knew! But I shan’t tell
him. Will you come around again and see me
later?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, thank you,” replied Perry. “And
Fudge isn’t <em>really</em> sorry you’re not the train-robber,
Mr. Addicks; are you, Fudge?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” Fudge grinned. “Anyway, it
was a lot of fun while it lasted!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then,” said their host heartily.
“Glad you don’t hold it against me. I know that
a civil engineer isn’t as interesting as a desperado,
fellows, but you drop in now and then and maybe
we can scare up some excitement, eh? And if you
ever want a nice job of surveying done, why, you
let me know, and it won’t cost you a cent.”</p>

<p>“S-s-surveying!” exclaimed Fudge. “We forgot
to t-t-t-tell him!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Perry agreed.</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. B-B-Brent, sir. You’re to g-g-go and
see him this forenoon and maybe he will have some
w-w-w-work for you.”</p>

<p>“You really mean it?” asked Mr. Addicks.
“Jonathan Brent, over at the mills? What makes
you think so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>Whereupon Fudge, Perry assisting, explained,
and when he had finished Mr. Addicks insisted on
shaking hands with them both very hard, so hard
that their fingers ached for minutes afterwards.</p>

<p>“You chaps are a couple of bricks!” he told them
delightedly. “I don’t see why you took the trouble
for me, but I’m certainly obliged. I hope Mr. Brent
will come across with the job. Even if he
shouldn’t, I thank you just the same. What sort
of a man is he, by the way?”</p>

<p>“He’s a small man,” replied Fudge uncertainly.
“Sort of wrinkled. Looks right through you and
out behind. Kind of scares you at first, I guess.
He’s got a lot of money and made it all himself.
Gives a heap of it away, though, they say. I guess,”
he summed up shrewdly, “that if you don’t let him
scare you, you’ll get on all right.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to,” answered Mr. Addicks gravely.
Perry smiled. The civil engineer didn’t exactly
look as if he would be easily frightened! And
then Fudge recalled Lanny’s message about the design
for the pennant.</p>

<p>“Dick said they couldn’t pay very much for it,”
he explained apologetically, “but maybe a couple
of dollars——”</p>

<p>“A couple of fiddlesticks! It won’t cost them
a cent. I’ll be glad to do it. We’ll talk it over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
this afternoon and I’ll make a sketch and you can
show it to your friend. I’m only sorry I’m not
doing it for you chaps.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will be, in a way,” replied Fudge
very gravely. “You see, that pennant’s to go to
the fellow making the most points in the Springdale
meet, and it’s as good as mine right now!”</p>

<p>Two days later there was a new pianist at the
moving picture theater, for Mr. Addicks was busy
with level and pole on a piece of work that would
occupy him at least a fortnight. And while there
had been no promise of further employment, the
surveyor was pretty certain that Mr. Brent meant
to keep him at work for some time to come. In
any case, he had made his start, and the false mustache
reposed nowadays on the wall of his room
surrounded by the penciled features of a villainous-looking
individual whom he called “Edward
Hurley, the Noted Train-Robber.” A card appeared
in the <cite>Reporter</cite> announcing that Myron Addicks,
Civil Engineer, was at the service of the
public, and a neat black-and-gold sign was hung
outside the entrance to the building. Later still
Mr. Addicks rented the adjoining room and used
it for an office and workshop. Gradually it assumed
a most business-like appearance. A long
table held fascinating drawing instruments and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
squares and protractors and strange black rubber
triangles and curves and rolls of tracing cloth and
printing-frames, to say nothing of paints and inks
simply begging investigation! To Fudge that room
was a never-failing source of delight, and, since
he and Perry soon became fast friends with Mr.
Addicks, he had frequent opportunities to test its
pleasures. By summer both he and Perry had
dedicated themselves to the profession of civil engineering
and were doing remarkable things with
compasses and ruling-pens and little black rubber
squares. It was, I think, shortly after the close
of school that Fudge commenced his ambitious
task of mapping the City of Clearfield! But I am
far ahead of my story.</p>

<p>The design for the Track Trophy was made,
submitted and enthusiastically approved. The pennant
itself was completed a week later and was
placed on exhibition in a window of Cosgrove’s
jewelry store. A placard neatly printed by Mr.
Addicks reposed beside it and explained that it
was to be awarded as a prize to that member of
the Clearfield High School Track Team winning
the greatest number of points at the annual meet
with Springdale High School. It was really a
very handsome trophy and Louise Brent and her
aids had done themselves proud. The pennant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
was twenty-four inches in length and fourteen
inches in height, of heavy purple silk. A wreath
of green laurel leaves enclosed the letters “C. H.
S.” in white. Purple satin ribbons held the pennant
to a gilt staff, and altogether it formed a
prize well worth striving for. And so most of
the Track Team members thought.</p>

<p>Besides inciting the members of the team themselves
to greater endeavors, the trophy aroused a
new interest in and enthusiasm for track and field
athletics throughout the school. Fellows who had
never for an instant contemplated going out for
the team were heard regretting the fact that they
had allowed others to dissuade them and promising
that next year they’d show something!</p>

<p>Meanwhile May hurried along with sunny skies—and
some cloudy ones for variety—and the baseball
players began to meet opponents worthy of
their skill and the Track Team, imbued with a new
enthusiasm, worked their hardest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<small>ON THE TRACK</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">By the middle of the month the Track Team
comprised twenty members, several less
than coach and captain had hoped for. By
a good deal of intricate scheming those twenty
were apportioned over the seven track and five field
events so that in each Clearfield would be represented
by not less than three wearers of the purple.
In many cases a second was the best that Captain
Felker dared hope for, in some cases a third
would be all he expected. A number of the fellows
were being coached in things they had never
dreamed of undertaking. George Tupper, for instance,
who had run fourth last spring in the 440-yards,
had been prevailed on to drop that event
and go in for the mile, since the four-forty was
represented by three more promising performers
and the mile run was left to Toll and Smith. In
the same way, Thad Brimmer, whose specialty was
the weights, was induced to make a third competitor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
in the high jump. Lanny White, who was
entered for both dashes and the high hurdles, entered
for the low hurdles also. Soper, a fair
sprinter, developed remarkably as a broad-jumper.</p>

<p>Of course there were disappointments at first
in what Arthur Beaton humorously called “intensive
track athletics.” That is, several fellows selected
for events that were new to them failed absolutely
to show any ability and had to be switched
to something else. Neither Coach Presser nor Captain
Felker hoped to develop extraordinary talent
in this way. What they desired to do was to be
represented in each event by at least three contestants
and so possibly gain here or there a point
or two that would otherwise go to Springdale.
When the final arrangement was completed there
were four entries for the 100-yards dash, the 220-yards
dash, the hammer-throw and the shot-put,
and three for each of the other events on the
program. Lanny White was to attempt more than
any other member of the team, being down for
four events, and several others were down for
three. Naturally, Lanny did not expect to be
placed in each of his races, but there was always
the chance of crowding a Springdale fellow out in
the trials. In the dashes Lanny was fairly certain
of getting a first and a second, if not two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
firsts, and he hoped to get placed in the high hurdles.
Perry Hull had attempted to show form as
a broad-jumper, but after a week of it had convinced
Skeet that that was not his forte. In the
end he was slated for the sprints only.</p>

<p>Perry had his second time-trial on the seventeenth
of the month and Skeet announced the
time as 10 3/5 for the hundred and 24 3/5 for the
two-twenty. Neither performance was remarkable,
but Perry had a strong belief in his ability
to better them both; and, in any case, he had performed
as well as any of his teammates except
Lanny and Kirke in the hundred and Lanny in
the two-twenty. Lanny told him he had done finely
and assured him that in another fortnight he would
be able to cut another fifth of a second from his
time. “And if you do,” said Lanny, “you’ll stand
as good a chance for second place as any of
the fellows. I don’t think that Springdale has
a sprinter who can do better than two-fifths
this year. It will be a corking race for second
place!”</p>

<p>Perry was encouraged and his enthusiasm arose
to new heights. For the next week he clamored
for another time-trial, but Skeet denied him. Instead,
he insisted on Perry working well over his
distance for days after that trial, and neither he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
nor the other sprinters were once allowed to show
their real speed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Perry was observing such strict rules
of diet that Mrs. Hull was in despair. Perry’s natural
liking for pie and cake was sternly repressed
and his mother became frequently quite impatient
and said that training was a piece of foolishness
and that Perry would soon be only skin and bones
unless he ate more. There seemed to be some justification
for her fears, for the steady work on
the cinders was certainly carving Perry pretty fine.
He had not been by any means fat before, but now
he was getting down to his muscles, and one morning
when his mother surprised him on his way to
the bath and viewed the slimness of his legs as
revealed by a flapping dressing-robe, she sent up a
wail of alarm and forthwith sought the Doctor,
declaring that “this running just had to be stopped
or Perry would starve to death before their eyes!
He looks right now,” she said, “like one of those
Indian famine victims!” But the Doctor declined
to become concerned. “He’s better off as
he is, Mother,” he replied. “A fifteen-year-old boy
doesn’t need fat.”</p>

<p>“But he’s not eating anything!”</p>

<p>“You mean,” the Doctor chuckled, “he’s not eating
pie and cake and a mess of sweet truck. I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
failed to notice, though, that he has ever refused
a third helping of meat and vegetables lately! Suppose,
instead of pie and chocolate layer-cake, you
make some simple puddings, my dear; tapioca, rice,
corn-starch. I guess he will eat those all right; and
they’ll be a lot better for him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hull retired unconvinced, but afterwards
forbore to predict disaster when Perry refused pie.
Experiments with the simple desserts the Doctor
had suggested were fairly successful. Perry referred
to a diet-list that was pinned beside his bureau and
relaxed to the extent of partaking sparingly of
the puddings.</p>

<p>Fudge, too, was denying himself prescribed
dishes, although with far less philosophy than was
displayed by his friend. Pie with Fudge was a
passion, and cakes containing oozing jelly or soft
icing filled his soul with beatitude. When all else
failed, he fell back on doughnuts. To be cut off
from these things was a woeful experience to
Fudge. Once he had “trained” for the Football
Team, but that training had been a very sketchy
performance; nothing at all like the awful self-denial
he practiced—or, at least, strove to practice—now.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind not eating starchy things,” he confided
to Perry one day, “but this breaking away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
from the table when the pie comes on is fierce! I
haven’t had a hunk of pie,” he added drearily, “for
three weeks, and there’s a place right here”—he
laid a sympathetic hand over the third button of
his vest—“that won’t be happy until it gets it!”</p>

<p>However, to make up for the discomforts of
dieting, he had the satisfaction of accomplishing
Herculean stunts with the twelve-pound hammer.
Partridge already viewed him as a probable point-winner,
for he had nearly equaled Falkland’s best
performance and had out-distanced Thad Brimmer
by four feet. It was well that Partridge, and Guy
Felker, too, dealt out praise and encouragement to
Fudge, for the temptation to backslide in the matter
of pie dogged him incessantly. There was one
tragic night when he lay in bed and fought for all
of an hour against the haunting vision of three
raisin pies sitting side by side in the pantry downstairs.
What eventually vanquished temptation
was the knowledge that if he stole down and cut
into one of those pies his mother would know it.
And after all the fine-sounding speeches he had
made to her on the subject of denying one’s appetite
for the sake of the School, he hadn’t the
heart for it.</p>

<p>Now that the School had “taken up” athletics it
was a lot more fun practicing. Whereas heretofore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
scarcely a dozen fellows had watched the
performances of the Track Team, now the daily
practice was almost as popular as baseball and
squads of critical but enthusiastic youths stood
about the track and applauded and urged on their
friends. The hammer-throw was sufficiently spectacular
to attract a large gallery every afternoon,
and I’m not denying that Fudge strutted a little
when, having tossed the weight far away across
the field, he allowed some admiring acquaintance
to help him on with the crimson dressing-robe he
affected.</p>

<p>Over at Springdale great things were said of the
local Track Team, and the Springdale paper even
now predicted victory. Guy Felker and the others
studied that paper every day and compared what
they learned of the Blue team’s performances with
what they knew of their own, sometimes with satisfaction
and more often with alarm. There was
no disguising the fact that Springdale would send
a team more than ordinarily strong in the quarter,
half and mile events and in the jumps. The Blue
was likely to prove weak in the sprints and hurdles
and at present seemed about on a par with
the Purple in the hammer-throw and shot-put.
Springdale’s best performer with the shot was credited
with thirty-nine feet and two inches, but Skeet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
declared himself skeptical about that. Arthur
Beaton spent hours at a time drawing up predictions
of the outcome of the dual meet which
proved, to his satisfaction at least, that the Purple
would win by a good fifteen points. But Beaton
was notably an optimist.</p>

<p>The plan of holding a School meet was abandoned
owing to the small number of members,
but, on the twenty-first of the month the entrants
in each event were allowed to compete against
each other and the results were posted. Skeet did
not, however, publish times or distances, although
they were made known to the contestants. In the
dashes Lanny finished first with ease, Kirke getting
second place in the hundred-yards and third
in the two-twenty. Perry tied with Soper for third
place in the short distance and finished fourth in
the two-twenty. Since, however, a blanket would
have covered all the sprinters but Lanny at the
finish of that race, fourth place was not vastly
different from second. The time was disappointing,
but the track was soft after an all-night rain
and Skeet didn’t seem troubled when he snapped
Lanny ten and two-fifths for the hundred and
twenty-four and three-fifths for the longer sprint.
The high hurdles went to Lanny and Beaton finished
only three yards behind him. Peyton fell at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
the second hurdle and was a poor third. In the
low hurdles Lanny was swept off his feet by Peyton
and had to work hard to beat out Beaton for
the next honors. The jumps developed poor performances,
but in the pole-vault Guy Felker surprised
himself and everyone else by doing ten feet
and one inch, bettering the school and the dual
record by two and a half inches. That and Partridge’s
shot-put of thirty-seven feet and two
inches were the only notable performances that
afternoon.</p>

<p>The mile run proved a good deal of a fizzle.
Smith, considered the only dependable entrant for
that event, had cramps and dropped out on the
third lap, and Toll and Tupper fought it out together,
Toll finishing well in the lead in the slow
time of six minutes and twenty seconds. Evidently
the result of the mile was a foregone conclusion
since it was well known that Springdale’s best miler
had a record of five minutes and five seconds. The
half-mile was a good race—Todd, Lasker and Train
finishing in that order, the winner’s time being
two minutes and fourteen and one-fifth seconds.
The quarter-mile saw Todd, Sears and Cranston
running bunched until the final fifty yards, when
Sears forged ahead and finished with his head up
in the fair time of fifty-four and four-fifths seconds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
In the hammer event, which wasn’t finished
until after six o’clock, Partridge won handily with
a best throw of one hundred and twenty-six feet
and seven inches. Falkland was second with a
hundred and twenty-one feet and three inches and
Fudge was third at a hundred and eighteen feet
and six inches. Thad Brimmer was in poor form
and was several feet behind Fudge.</p>

<p>The contests brought out many faults not displayed
previously, and to that extent were useful.
Possibly, too, they served to accustom new members
of the team to the conditions of competition.
At any rate, the fellows enjoyed them, and the audience
did too. There was one member of the
audience who, seated in the grandstand, watched
events with a deal of interest. This was Mr. Addicks.
As it was Saturday and work was for the
time slack, he had treated himself to an afternoon
off. No one paid any attention to him; few, indeed,
observed him; certainly neither Perry nor
Fudge. He would have liked to have gone down
on the field and mingled with the throngs along
the track and about the pits, but since he was not
a High School fellow he thought he might be
trespassing. There was no ball game to-day to
divide attention, for the Nine had gone off to play
against, and, incidentally, get drubbed by Templeton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
College. Mr. Addicks watched the sprints and
hurdle events critically and found no fault with
Lanny White’s work. Lanny, he concluded, was
a born sprinter and hurdler and only needed better
training to become a master of those arts. With
the rest, though, he was far less satisfied. Indeed,
he frowned a good deal over the running of the
other three competitors. He didn’t remain until
the end, but left the field after the quarter-mile
run. He had wanted to see Fudge’s performance
with the hammer, for Fudge had talked rather importantly
of it of late, but he couldn’t see that event
taking place anywhere and didn’t think to look outside
the field. On the way back to town he stopped
in the telegraph office and made use of a telegram
blank to write a brief note. This he dropped
through the letter-slot in Dr. Hull’s front door, and
Perry found it awaiting him when he got home. It
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Alkali Ike</span>: Come and see me this evening if you
can. If not, in the morning. Death to traitors!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Deadwood Dick.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Ever since he had learned of the boys’ suspicions
regarding him, Mr. Addicks had humorously insisted
on applying such picturesque aliases to them
and himself. Fudge was “Four-Fingered Pete,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
usually, although sometimes he was addressed as
“Willie Rufus, the Boy Detective.” Perry was
variously “Alkali Ike,” “Doctor Watson” or “The
Apache Kid.” Perry smiled as he read the missive,
got Fudge on the telephone and announced
his purpose of calling on Mr. Addicks after supper
and instructed Fudge to join him there, and
then descended hungrily on the contents of the table.
He was very full of the afternoon’s proceedings
and, although he didn’t suspect it, I fancy his
father and mother were relieved when the meal
was over and he grabbed his cap and disappeared.</p>

<p>He found Mr. Addicks working at a drawing-table
in the new room into which he had moved
a few days before, but his host laid aside pen and
ruler, square and compass, and took him into the
old apartment, now a trifle more comfortable by
reason of the acquisition of a second-hand easy-chair.
Into this he forced Perry and took his own
position as usual on a corner of the table.</p>

<p>“I saw you run to-day,” he announced, “and I
want to talk to you about it.”</p>

<p>“Were you there?” asked Perry. “I didn’t see
you. Why didn’t you let me know?”</p>

<p>“I sat in the stand. I didn’t know whether they’d
want me on the field.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“Shucks, everyone comes on. I wish I’d known
you were there. What—what did you think of it?”</p>

<p>“The field?” asked Mr. Addicks innocently.</p>

<p>“No, I mean the—the sprinting and all.”</p>

<p>“I thought that fellow White was a mighty
clever runner, Perry. I don’t know that I ever saw
a chap handle himself much better. Of course
he wasn’t half trying to-day. He didn’t have to.
I’d like to see him when he was pushed.”</p>

<p>“He’s fine, Lanny is,” said Perry admiringly.
“And Kirke is pretty good, too, didn’t you think?
He got second in the hundred, you know.”</p>

<p>“That his name? Well, he’s not the sprinter
White is. Is that little thin fellow your trainer?
The fellow in the brown-and-white sweater?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s Skeet Presser. He used to be a
champion miler; or maybe it was half-miler; I forget.”</p>

<p>“Is he considered a good coach?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir! He trains at the Y. M. C. A.,
you know.”</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks smiled. “Well, that ought to be
conclusive, Perry! But let me ask you something
now. Who taught you how to run?”</p>

<p>“Why, he did; he and Lanny. Lanny coaches
the sprinters sometimes.”</p>

<p>“White, you mean? Well, did either of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
ever tell you that you ought to use your arms in
running?”</p>

<p>“My arms? No, sir, I don’t think so. Skeet
told me I wasn’t to let my arms get behind me.”</p>

<p>“That was clever of him,” said Mr. Addicks
dryly. “Have you ever watched your friend White
run?”</p>

<p>“Yes, lots of times.”</p>

<p>“Ever notice what he does with his arms?”</p>

<p>Perry hesitated. “I don’t think so, particularly.”</p>

<p>“Well, you should. Look here, Perry, you’re
not really running, my boy. You made a nice
start to-day in the two-twenty and you used a nice
stride when you found it, which wasn’t until you
were pretty nearly to the tape, but you waved your
arms all over the lot and never once used them to
help your running. Now if you’re ever going to
do anything in the sprints, or in the distances,
either, you’ve got to learn how to use your arms.
A sprinter runs with three things, Perry; his legs,
his arms and his head. You use your legs fairly
well, although you’re trying to get too long a stride
for a chap with legs the length yours are; and I
guess you’ll learn to use your head well enough
when you’ve been in a few races; but you aren’t
getting anything out of your arms; in fact, you’re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
slowing yourself up, the way you’re beating the
air with them.” Mr. Addicks slid off the table.
“Suppose I wave my arms like this when I’m running.
Think that’s any help to me? Not a bit,
old scout. Get your arm action and leg action together.
Rip them forward, like this; left leg, right
arm, right leg, left arm. That way you’re pulling
yourself along. But don’t just hold them out and
paddle your hands, or trail them behind your
hips or hug your chest with them the way one
of you chaps did to-day. See what I mean at
all?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. I never knew about that,
though.”</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t if no one told you. Not
one of you fellows except White ran in decent form
to-day; and if someone would tell him not to throw
his head back as far as he does he’d do better yet.
What the dickens does this Skeet fellow think?
That you kids can find out all these things without
being told? Why, great, jumping Geewhillikins,
there are all sorts of things to be learned if you’re
going to be a real sprinter! It isn’t just getting off
the mark quick and running as hard as you know
how to the tape. There’s science in it, old scout,
a heap of science!”</p>

<p>“I suppose there is,” replied Perry a trifle dejectedly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
“And I don’t suppose I’ll ever be real
good at it.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Don’t expect to be a ten-flat hundred-yard
man yet, though. You’re too young and
your legs are too short and your lungs aren’t big
enough. For two or three years the two-twenty
will be your best distance. You can’t hustle into
your stride and move fast enough to compete with
older fellows in the hundred. But, if you’ll
realize that in the two-twenty you can’t push all the
way, you may make a good performer. You have
a pretty fair style, Perry. I like the way you
throw your heels without ‘dragging,’ for one thing.
But what I’ve just said about trying all the way
through the two-twenty is so. It can’t be done;
at least, it can’t be done by the average sprinter.
Get your stride as soon as you can after you’re
off the mark, then let your legs carry you a while;
I mean by that don’t put all your strength into the
going; save something for the last thirty yards
or so. Then let yourself out! Remember that
the hundred-yards is a hustle all the way, but the
two-twenty is just a hundred and twenty yards
longer and the fellow who tries to win in the first
half of the race dies at the finish. Of course, it
all comes by trying and learning. Experience
brings judgment, and judgment is what a sprinter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
has to have. You’ll soon find out just about how
much power you can spend in getting away and
how much you can use in the first twenty seconds
and how much you’ll need for the final spurt. Only,
until you have learned that, play it safe and don’t
try all the way. If you do you’ll finish tied up in
a hard knot! See what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Try it and see if I’m not right.” Mr. Addicks
perched himself on the table again and
swung a foot thoughtfully. “I wish I had the
coaching of you for a couple of weeks,” he said.
“I’d make a two-twenty man out of you or I miss
my guess!”</p>

<p>“I wish you had,” replied Perry wistfully. “No
one told me all that, Mr. Addicks. Couldn’t you—I
mean, I don’t suppose you’d have time to show
me, would you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not.” Mr. Addicks shook his head.
“I’d like to, though. I guess the trouble with this
Skeet fellow is that he’s got so much on his hands
he can’t give thorough attention to any one thing.
Still, I should think he’d see that his sprinters are
making a mess of it. White ought to savvy it, anyway.”
He was silent a minute. Then: “Look
here,” he said abruptly, “what time do you get up
in the morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>“About seven, usually. Sometimes a little before.”</p>

<p>“Seven! Great Snakes, that’s halfway to sundown!
That the best you can do?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I could get up a lot earlier if I wanted
to.”</p>

<p>“Well, you get up a lot earlier some morning
and we’ll go out to the track and I’ll show you
what I’m talking about. Swallow a cup of coffee,
or whatever it is you drink in the morning; that’s
all you’ll need; we won’t try anything stiff. What
do you say to that?”</p>

<p>“Why,” replied Perry eagerly, “that would be
dandy! Will you really do it, sir? When?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow—no, to-morrow’s Sunday. How
about Monday? Be outside your house at six
and——”</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks was interrupted by a knock on the
door, and, in response to a lusty “Come in!” Fudge
entered.</p>

<p>“Ah,” exclaimed Mr. Addicks, “we have with us
to-night Arizona Bill, the Boy Hercules!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<small>THE NEW COACH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That early morning session at the track
didn’t come off on Monday because it was
raining hard when the alarm clock which
Perry had borrowed for the occasion buzzed frantically
at a quarter to six. It had been agreed that
should it be raining the event was to be postponed.
So it was Tuesday when Mr. Addicks gave his
first lesson. He was already in front of the house
when Perry hurried out. He was enveloped from
neck to ankles in a thread-bare brown ulster beneath
which he wore an old pair of running-trunks
and a faded green shirt.</p>

<p>“Thought it might do me good to take a little
exercise while I’m out there,” he explained. “I
haven’t had these things on for years, and wasn’t
sure I’d kept them until I rummaged through my
trunk. Couldn’t find my shoes, though.” Perry
saw that he was wearing a pair of rubber-soled
canvas “sneakers” which had probably been white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
a long time ago. “How are you feeling? Ever
up so early before?”</p>

<p>“A few times,” Perry laughed. “Usually on
the Fourth.”</p>

<p>“Had anything to eat or drink?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, the fire wasn’t lighted. I’m not hungry,
though.”</p>

<p>“Better have something inside you. We’ll stop
at the drug store and get some hot malted-milk.”</p>

<p>This they did, and then went on to the field. It
was a fine, warm May morning, and after yesterday’s
showers the world looked and smelled
fresh and fragrant. They found the gates at the
field locked, but it was no trick at all to climb over
the fence. Fudge had agreed to meet them there
with his stop-watch, although Mr. Addicks had assured
him that a time-trial was unthought of, but
he was not on hand nor did he appear at all that
morning. Later he explained that the maid had
forgotten to call him.</p>

<p>Inside, Mr. Addicks threw off his ulster and,
while Perry got into his running togs, stretched
his long legs and surprised his muscles by various
contortions to which they were long unused. Perry
was soon back and Mr. Addicks put him on his
mark and sent him away at little more than a jog.
“Head up,” he instructed. “Shorten your stride.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
That’s better. Don’t be afraid to use the flat of
your foot. Running on your toes is too hard on
your legs. Now swing your arms, Perry. Drive
’em out and pull ’em back, boy! No, no, don’t
make an effort of it. Just easy, just easy. That’s
better.”</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks trotted alongside to the turn and
then called a halt.</p>

<p>“That’s enough. Now get your breath and
watch the way I do it. Watch my arms particularly.”</p>

<p>He crouched for a start, unlike the usual sprinter
holding but one hand to the ground. Then he
launched forward, caught his stride almost at once
and ran lightly back along the track, his long legs
scarcely seeming to make any effort and his arms
reaching forward and back, his body twisting
slightly above the hips from side to side. It was
pretty work, and even Perry, who had never seen
many runners, realized that he was watching one
who was, allowing for lack of recent practice, a
past-master. After that he was sent off again and
again, for short distances, at scarcely more than
a trot until he at last solved the philosophy of the
arm movement. He had begun to despair of ever
getting the hang of it when, suddenly, he awoke
to the realization that, for the first time since he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
had been running, legs, arms and body were working
together in perfect unison! He had the novel
sensation of being a well-oiled machine of which
every part was timing absolutely! He slowed down
at the corner and returned to his instructor with
shining eyes, triumphant and slightly astonished.</p>

<p>“I did it!” he exclaimed. “I did it then, Mr. Addicks!
Did you see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you got it at last. Notice the difference?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Of course you do! Before you were fighting
with yourself. Now your muscles all work together.
Sit down a minute and rest. Then I want
to see you start from the mark down there and
come fairly fast to the corner. See how quickly
you can get your stride and your form. Run easily
to about that white mark on the rim up there and
finish hard.”</p>

<p>Because Perry feared that the others would
think him silly, he had sworn Fudge to secrecy
regarding the early-morning lessons, and Fudge,
who was as communicative a youth as any in Clearfield
but could be as close-mouthed as a sulky clam
on occasions, kept the secret, and no one but Mr.
Addicks, his pupil and Fudge knew until long
after what went on at Brent Field between six and
seven on fair mornings. Perry learned fast, partly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
because he was naturally an apt pupil and partly
because Mr. Addicks was a patient and capable
instructor. When a point couldn’t be made quite
clear with words Mr. Addicks stepped onto the cinders
and illustrated it, and Perry couldn’t help but
understand. I think Mr. Addicks got as much
pleasure, and possibly as much benefit, from the lessons
as Perry did. He confessed the second morning
that what little running he had done the day
before had lamed him considerably, and declared
his intention of getting back into trim again and
staying there. At the end of a week he was doing
two and three laps of the track and never feeling
it. Fudge, who joined them occasionally, became
ardently admiring of such running as that of Mr.
Addicks’ and regretted that he had not gone in
for the middle distances. “That,” he confided to
Perry one morning, “is what I call the p-p-p-poetry
of motion!” And he managed to make it sound
absolutely original!</p>

<p>Mr. Addicks insisted that Perry should specialize
on the two-hundred-and-twenty-yards dash, and
coached him carefully over almost every foot of
that distance, from the moment he put his spikes
into the holes and awaited the signal, until he had
crossed the line, arms up and head back. Perry,
who had been complimented on his starting, discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
to his surprise that he was very much of
a duffer at it. Mr. Addicks made him arrange his
holes further apart in each direction and showed
him how to crouch with less strain on his muscles.
And he showed him how to get away from
the mark with a quicker straightening of the body,
so that, after a week of practice, he could find his
stride at the end of the first fifteen yards and be
running with body straight and in form. And
then at last one morning there came a time-trial
over the two hundred and twenty yards and, with
Fudge sending him away and Mr. Addicks holding
the watch at the finish, Perry put every ounce
of power into his running and trotted back to be
shown a dial on which the hand had been stopped
at twenty-four and one-fifth!</p>

<p>“Why—why——” stammered Perry breathlessly,
“that’s a fifth under the time Lanny made last
year!”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t signify much,” replied Mr. Addicks.
“This time may be a fifth of a second wrong
one way or another. And you must remember
that White probably made his record when he was
tired from the hundred yards. Anyway, it’s fair
time, Perry, and if you can do as well as that in
the meet you’ll probably get second place at least.”</p>

<p>Fudge, hurrying up to learn the result, stuttered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
rapturously on being told. “I t-t-t-told him he’d m-m-m-make
a p-p-peach of a s-s-s-sprinter! D-d-d-didn’t——”</p>

<p>“You did,” laughed Perry. “Couldn’t I try the
hundred now, Mr. Addicks?”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, son. Too much is enough. We’ll
try that some other time. Don’t work too hard
this afternoon, by the way. It’s easy to get stale
at this stage of the game. And the meet is less
than two weeks off.”</p>

<p>“Gee,” sighed Fudge, “I w-w-wish you’d sh-sh-show
me something about th-th-th-throwing the
hammer!”</p>

<p>“I would if I knew anything about it, Fudge.
But I thought you were getting on swimmingly.”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair, sir. Only Falkland keeps on beating
me by four or five feet every time. I wish
I were taller, that’s what I wish! He’s almost six
inches taller than I am and his arms are
longer.”</p>

<p>“You might wear stilts,” Perry suggested.</p>

<p>“Or put French heels on your shoes,” laughed
Mr. Addicks.</p>

<p>Fudge sighed dolefully and then brightened.
“Anyway,” he said, “I can beat Thad! And he’s
older than I, and bigger, too.”</p>

<p>“Whatever happens,” said Mr. Addicks as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
crossed the field, “I’ve got to see that meet, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Fudge. “Mr. Brent will let
you off, won’t he?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t Mr. Brent who has the say so,” replied
the other with a smile. “It’s my pocketbook,
Fudge.”</p>

<p>“Oh! But I thought you were making a heap
of money now, sir. You went and took that other
room and—and all.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I’m still poor, Four-Fingered Pete.
Earning an honest living is hard work. Sometimes
I think I’ll go back to train-robbery.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you ever going to forget that?” wailed
Fudge.</p>

<p>Baseball was now well into mid-season. Seven
games had been played, of which two had been
lost, one tied and the rest won. A Second Team,
captained by Sprague McCoy, was putting the regulars
on their mettle three afternoons a week and
was playing an occasional contest of its own with
an outside nine. Dick Lovering was fairly well
satisfied with his charges, although it was too early
to predict what was to happen in the final game
with Springdale, nearly a month distant. The
pitching staff was gradually coming around into
shape now that warm weather had arrived. Tom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
Haley, still first-choice box-artist, had pitched a
no-hit game against Locust Valley and of late had
gone well-nigh unpunished.</p>

<p>The Templeton game had been somewhat of a
jolt, to use Captain Jones’ inelegant but expressive
phrase, inasmuch as Templeton had been looked
on as an easy adversary, and Joe Browne, in process
of being turned into a third-choice pitcher,
had started in the box against them. Joe had been
literally slaughtered in exactly two-thirds of one
inning and had thereupon gone back to right field,
yielding the ball to Nostrand. But Nostrand,
while faring better, had been by no means invulnerable.
Even if he had held the enemy safe,
however, Clearfield would still have been defeated,
for her hitting that day was so poor that she
was unable to overcome the four runs which Templeton
had piled up in that luckless first inning.
The First Team had to stand a deal of ragging
from the Second Team fellows when they got
back, for the Second had gone down to Lesterville
and won handily from a hard-hitting team
of mill operatives who had claimed the county
championship for several years. To be sure, the
Second Team fellows had returned rather the
worse for wear, Terry Carson having a black
eye, Howard Breen a badly spiked instep and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
McCoy a bruised knee, but still they had conquered!</p>

<p>The first game with Springdale—they played a
series for two games out of three—was scheduled
for the fourth of June at Clearfield. The second
contest was to be held at Springdale a week later,
which was the date of the dual meet, and the third,
if necessary, was to take place at Clearfield on
the seventeenth. Just now it was on the first of
these contests that the eyes of Dick and Captain
Warner Jones and the players themselves were
fixed. Dick was anxious to get that first game,
whatever happened afterwards. In the second contest
Clearfield was to do without the services of
Lanny as catcher, for Lanny was due on that day
to stow away some thirteen or fourteen points for
the Track Team, and while Pete Robey could be
depended on to catch a good game, Lanny’s absence
from the line-up was bound to be felt. So
Dick was out after that first encounter, realizing
that with that put safely on ice he would be able
to accept a defeat the following Saturday with a
fair degree of philosophy. Perhaps, fortunately
for the nine, two other members who had tried
for the Track Team had failed, and Lanny was
the only one who stood to make history in two
branches of athletics this spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>Bert Cable, last year’s captain, labored indefatigably
and was of much assistance to Dick who,
handicapped as he was by his infirmity, was forced
to do most of his coaching from the bench. That
was an extremely busy week for the Clearfield
High School Baseball Team, and Gordon Merrick
confided to Lanny on Thursday that if Dick sent
him to the batting-net the next day he would probably
go mad and bite someone. “Why, last night,”
he said, “I dreamed that Tom and Nostrand and
Joe Browne and two or three others were all pitching
to me at once! My arms are still lame from
that nightmare!”</p>

<p>“Well, there won’t be anything very strenuous
to-morrow,” Lanny comforted. “In fact, you’ll
get off easier than I shall, for I’ve got to do track
work.”</p>

<p>“You’re an idiot to try both,” said Gordon.
“What’s going to happen to us next week, I’d like
to know, with Robey catching.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Pete will get along all right. In fact, he’s
a mighty good catcher, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“He’s all right at catching, but a child could
steal on him. He can’t get the ball down to second
to save his life until the runner’s brushing the
dust from his trousers!”</p>

<p>“Well, with Tom Haley pitching the runner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
ought not to get a start off first. Tom’s the one
who can hold ’em.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I’ll bet you anything they steal a
half-dozen times on us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let them get to first,” advised Lanny.
“That’s the safest plan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, safety first,” agreed the other. “How
many races are you down for next week, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“Four, sprints and hurdles. But I may not run
them all. It depends on who qualifies. If Arthur
and Eg Peyton get placed for the low hurdles I’ll
probably drop out. By the way, that young Hull
is quite a find, Gordie. I wouldn’t be surprised to
see him get a second in the two-twenty. He’s developing
into a mighty spry youth. Runs nicely,
too. Lots of form. Funny thing is he never tried
the sprints until this spring.”</p>

<p>“I guess Skeet is a pretty good trainer, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes. Yes, Skeet’s all right. The only trouble
with Skeet is that he can’t seem to get it into his
head that our chaps are just youngsters. He expects
them to stand a lot of hard work and then
can’t understand why they get tired and loaf. Still,
he’s all right, and I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if
we won this year.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Gordon laughed, “with you taking part
in most of the stunts, I don’t see how you can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
help it. How many points are you supposed to annex,
anyway?”</p>

<p>“Thirteen or fourteen; fourteen if I’m in luck.”</p>

<p>“How many do we have to have to win? Fifty-something,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Fifty-four ties. Anything more than that wins.
Arthur has it doped out that we’re to get firsts
in six events; both sprints, the high hurdles, the
quarter-mile, the pole-vault and the shot-put, and
enough seconds and thirds to give us sixty points.”</p>

<p>“First place counts five and second place
three——”</p>

<p>“And third place one. I don’t remember just
how Arthur arrives at his result, but he gets there
somehow. It’s going to be a good meet, anyhow,
and I’m sorry you won’t be here to see it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I shall be,” responded Gordon pessimistically,
“if Dick doesn’t stop batting practice. I’ve
only got two arms, and they won’t swing many
more times without dropping off! I’d like to see
you run away from those Springdale chumps, too.
I suppose you’ll win that purple pennant the girls
have put up.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know about that. I wouldn’t object to
having it. It’s mighty good-looking, and purple
goes well with my complexion.”</p>

<p>“Complexion!” jibed Gordon. “You haven’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
any more complexion than a board fence. By the
way, did you see that they were patching the fence
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I hear they’re going to fix up the
track for us a bit before the meet. Wonder where
they’re getting the money. Last time I heard anything
about it they had about sixty cents in the
treasury.”</p>

<p>“We’ve had two or three pretty fair-sized crowds
out there so far. I dare say the Corwin game
brought in fifty or sixty dollars.”</p>

<p>“And they got a third of it. Well, I don’t care
where the money comes from. I’m glad they’re
going to mend the track. I’d hate to have Springdale
see it the way it is.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s silly to fix it. They ought to leave
it the way it is and pray for rain. Then maybe
some of the Springdale chaps would fall in the puddles
and drown.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a mean disposition,” laughed
Lanny.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a very fine disposition,” returned Gordon
with dignity, “but it’s being ruined by Dick
Lovering and batting practice. Bet you anything I
don’t get a single hit Saturday.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, don’t; make ’em all doubles! By
the way, they’ll probably work that left-hander of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
theirs against us in the first game. I wish we had
more left-hand batters.”</p>

<p>“That will give Breen a show, maybe. He and
Cotner and Scott are our only port-siders, I think.”</p>

<p>“Nostrand bats left-handed. If Springdale
pitches Newton, Dick may use Nostrand instead of
Tom Haley. I hope he doesn’t, though. Nostrand’s
a pretty fair pitcher, but he can’t hold them
on the bases the way Tom can.”</p>

<p>“No, and he scares me to death every time he
pegs across. I always expect the ball to go over
my head. He needs a lot of practice throwing to
first.”</p>

<p>“He’s a corking good fielder, though, Gordie.
Don’t forget that. Well, here’s where I leave you.
What are you doing this evening?”</p>

<p>“Nothing special. I’ve got some chemistry work
to make up, though. Why? Anything doing?”</p>

<p>“Come on over to Morris’s. He’s fixed some
electric lights over the tennis court and is going to
try and play at night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t remember being invited.”</p>

<p>“What of it? It isn’t a party.”</p>

<p>“All right, but don’t expect me to play. It’s
too much like swinging a bat! Stop by for me.”</p>

<small>OUT AT THE PLATE!</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Clearfield turned out well on Saturday
for the first Springdale game, while the
visitors swelled the proceeds by filling most
of one whole section behind third base. The day
was fair but rather too cool for the players, with
a chilly east wind blowing down the field, a wind
that puffed up the dust from the base-paths,
whisked bits of paper around and interfered to
some extent with the judging of flies in the outfield.
Springdale was in holiday mood, armed with
a multitude of blue banners and accompanied by
a thick sprinkling of blue-gowned young ladies
whose enthusiasm was even more intense than that
of their escorts. Clearfield’s cheerers had to work
hard to equal the slogans that came down from
that third-base stand, and Toby Sears, cheer-leader,
was forced to many appeals before he got the results
he wanted.</p>

<p>Clearfield’s line-up was the same she had presented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
in Wednesday’s game against Benton:
Bryan, 2b.; Farrar, cf.; Merrick, 1b.; Scott, 3b.;
Cotner, lf.; Jones, ss.; White, c.; Browne, rf.;
Nostrand, p. Haley was expected to go to the rescue
if needed, and seven substitutes adorned the
bench and hoped to get into the game. Springdale
started with her left-hander, Newton, on the
mound, and Newton, who was a big, lazy-looking
but quite competent youth, disposed of Bryan, Farrar
and Merrick without difficulty. Neither team
hit safely, in fact, until the last of the third, when
Lanny managed to land a short fly just beyond
third-baseman’s reach. But Lanny, although he
reached second on a sacrifice bunt by Browne,
didn’t see the plate, for Newton registered his
third strike-out against Nostrand and caused
Bryan to hit into second-baseman’s hands.</p>

<p>In the fourth inning Springdale had a batting
streak that lasted until she had men on third and
second with but one out. Then Tom Nostrand
passed the next batsman, who had a reputation
for long hits to the outfield, and, with the bases
filled and the blue flags waving hopefully, he struck
out the next two opponents. The cheer that went
up from the Clearfield stand when the last man
turned away from the plate was undoubtedly plainly
heard on the other side of town!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>Clearfield’s inning produced plenty of thrills.
Farrar went out, shortstop to first, but Gordon
drove a clean safety over second and went to third
when Scott doubled to right. Cotner did his best
to sacrifice to the outfield, but the result was a foul
back of first and a second put-out. The Springdale
catcher made two bluff throws to second, hoping
to coax Gordon to the plate, but the trick didn’t
work. With two balls and one strike against him,
Captain Jones refused the next delivery and had
the satisfaction of hearing it declared a ball. Then
Newton floated a slow one over for a second strike
and, with the Clearfield coachers howling like wildmen
and the Purple’s supporters shouting from the
stands, tried to cut the outer corner of the plate.
Warner spoiled it and the ball glanced into the
seats. On third Gordon danced and ran back and
forth, while Scott, halfway between third and second,
dared a throw. Again Newton wound up and
again he stepped forward, and the ball sailed
straight along the groove. Gordon dashed up the
path from third, bat and ball met and Captain
Jones sped to first. Scott rounded the last corner
and headed for the plate just as the ball bounded
into the hands of the second-baseman. The
latter had plenty of time to peg across to first
ahead of Warner Jones, but something, perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
sight of the two runners flying home, made him
hesitate for one fatal instant. When the ball did
reach the first baseman’s impatient glove Jones
was crossing the bag.</p>

<p>Scott slid unchallenged past the plate and tallied
the home team’s second run, and Clearfield exulted
strenuously and waved purple flags. Two runs
looked very large just then, but Dick wanted more
and sent Lanny after them. Jones had instructions
to steal on the second pitch and Lanny to
hit it out if he could. Newton drove Lanny back
from the plate with his first delivery and it went
for a ball. Then, after throwing twice to first to
teach Jones discretion, he sailed a low one over.
Lanny swung at it but missed and Jones beat out
the throw to second by an eyelash. Clearfield
howled its glee. That steal upset Newton and he
allowed a pass. With men on second and first and
Joe Browne up another tally seemed quite within
the bounds of reason, but Newton found himself
again and, working Browne into the hole with two
strikes and one ball, fooled him on an outshoot
that looked very wide of the plate. Clearfield
shrieked disapproval of the decision, but disapproval
didn’t put the runners back on the bases or
return Browne to the plate. Still, two runs were
two runs, and, unless Springdale did a lot better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
than she had been doing, would prove sufficient to
win the game.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth passed uneventfully.
Springdale worked hard and took advantage of
everything, but luck was against her when Cotner
ran back to the shadow of the fence in deep left
and pulled down a long fly that might easily have
been good for two bases. Springdale had a runner
on first at the time and Cotner’s spectacular
catch undoubtedly robbed her of a tally. After
that Scott threw out the next batsman and
Bryan tossed to Jones on the following play.
In her half Clearfield got one man to first on balls,
but watched the succeeding three retire on easy
outs.</p>

<p>It was in the sixth that Springdale began to
look dangerous. Dick had substituted Breen for
Joe Browne, in the hope that the former would
take more kindly to Newton’s delivery, and it was
Breen who was directly responsible for what happened.
Nostrand disposed of the first batsman
easily enough, but the next man waited him out
and finally, after popping fouls all over the place,
secured a pass. The next man laid down a slow
bunt toward the box and Nostrand fielded to Jones.
The latter, however, failed to complete the double.
The following batter hit safely past Scott and second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
and first bases were occupied. Springdale’s
catcher was up now and he had so far proved an
easy victim to Nostrand’s slow ball. But this time
the signs failed. With two strikes against him
he managed to connect with a waister and sent it
arching into short right field. Gordon started back,
but it was quite evidently Breen’s ball, and Breen
was trotting in for it. But something happened.
Perhaps the wind caught the sphere and caused
the fielder’s undoing. At all events, the ball went
over Breen’s head by several feet and two runs
crossed the plate!</p>

<p>In the ensuing dismay and confusion the batsman
slid safely to second. Springdale stood up and
yelled like mad, and, after a minute of dismayed
silence, Toby Sears managed to arouse the purple-decked
seats to response. But the Clearfield cheering
was lacking in conviction just then! Breen,
feeling horribly conspicuous out there in right field,
ground his fist into the palm of his glove and
gritted his teeth. Captain Jones’ voice came back
to him cheerfully:</p>

<p>“Never mind that, Howard! Let’s go after ’em
hard now!”</p>

<p>And go after them hard they did, and when
Newton, the subsequent batsman, slammed the ball
into short center Breen was there as soon as Farrar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
and could have fielded the ball had not Farrar
attended to it. As it was the batsman was satisfied
with one base, although the runner ahead
reached third in safety.</p>

<p>Tom Haley had begun to warm up back of first
base now. That his services would be required
was soon evident, for Nostrand put himself in a
hole with the next batsman and finally watched him
walk to first and fill the bases. Then Dick nodded,
Nostrand dropped the ball and walked out and
Clearfield cheered lustily as Tom Haley peeled off
his sweater. Going into the box with the bases
full, even when there are two out, isn’t a thing to
rejoice and be merry over, but, as Fudge confided
to Perry just then, Tom Haley had been put together
without nerves. Tom sped some fast and
rather wild ones in the general direction of Lanny
while the Springdale shortstop leaned on his bat
and watched satirically, and the Blue’s supporters
expressed derision. But none of the Clearfield fellows
were worried by Tom’s apparent wildness.
Tom always did that when he went as a relief
pitcher. And then he usually tied the batsman in
knots!</p>

<p>Tom did that very thing now. He landed the
first ball squarely across the center of the plate.
He put the next one shoulder-high across the inner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
corner, and he wasted two more in trying to
coax the batter to reach out. Then, finding that
the blue-stockinged one would not oblige him, he
curved his fingers cunningly about the ball and shot
it away and, without waiting, swung on his heel
and walked out of the box and across the diamond,
while Clearfield applauded hysterically and a disgruntled
Springdale shortstop tossed his bat down
and turned toward the field wondering if he had
really hit as much too soon as it had seemed to
him!</p>

<p>The Purple went out in order in their half and
the seventh inning, which Clearfield, according to
time-honored custom, hailed as the “lucky seventh”
and stood up for, passed into history without adding
further tallies to the score of either team.
Springdale went after the game savagely and succeeded
in connecting with Haley’s offers so frequently
that the Clearfield supporters sat on the
edges of their seats and writhed anxiously. But,
although the Blue’s batsmen hit the ball, they failed
to “put it where they ain’t,” and sharp, clean fielding
did the rest. For her part, the Purple did no
better. One long fly to deep left looked good for
a moment, but the nimble-footed player out there
got under it without any trouble. No one reached
first in either half of the “lucky seventh” and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
game went into the eighth with the score still 2
to 2.</p>

<p>When the first man had been thrown out, Haley
to Merrick, Haley let down a mite and the Springdale
right-fielder smashed out a two-bagger that
sailed high over Bryan’s head and rolled far into
the outfield. After that Haley tightened up again
and struck out the next candidate, and the half
was over a few minutes later when the runner was
caught flat-footed off second by a rattling throw-down
by Lanny which Bryan took on the run.</p>

<p>Merrick was first up in the last half of the inning
and, obeying instructions, hit desperately at
the first ball pitched, missed it to the glee of the
Springdale “rooters” and staggered back out of the
box. The next delivery was low and wide. The
next one, too, was a ball. Then came a slow drop,
and Gordon, sizing it up nicely, stepped forward
and laid his bat gently against it. It wasn’t an
ideal ball to bunt, but Gordon managed to get his
bat a bit over it and at the same moment start for
first. The ball trickled but a scant six feet to
the left of base, but the catcher overran it slightly
and threw low to first and Gordon was safe.</p>

<p>Scott tried hard to sacrifice with a bunt, but
Newton kept them almost shoulder-high and before
he knew it Scott was in the hole. With the score<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
two and one Newton could afford to waste one,
and after he had tried the patience of the crowd
by repeated efforts to catch Gordon napping at
first, he sent in a slow ball that Scott refused.
Then, since the batsman had two strikes on him
and would naturally not risk an attempt to bunt,
Newton tried to end the agony by sending a
straight ball waist-high over the outer corner of
the plate. Whereupon Scott did exactly what he’d
been told to do and laid the ball down very neatly
halfway between plate and box and streaked to
first. He almost made it, too, but a quick turn and
throw by Newton beat him by a foot. Gordon,
however, was safely on second, and Clearfield rejoiced
loudly.</p>

<p>Cotner continued the bunting game, but although
he advanced Gordon to third his bunt went
straight to the waiting third-baseman, who had
been playing well in, and he made the second out.
Warner Jones got a fine round of applause as he
stepped to the bat and there were cries of “Give
us a home-run, Cap!” “Knock the cover off it!”
“Here’s where we score!” At third-base Gordon
ran back and forth along the path and the coach
shouted vociferously, but Newton refused to get
rattled. Instead, to the deep disgust of the Clearfield
adherents, he pitched four wide balls and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
Warner, tossing aside his bat, walked resentfully
to first. Clearfield loudly censured the pitcher, impolitely
intimating that he was afraid, but Newton
only smiled and gave his attention to Lanny. Four
more pitch-outs and Lanny, too, walked, filling the
bases and eliciting derisive and disappointed howls
from the Purple.</p>

<p>Breen was next at bat and, since in spite of being
a left-hander, he had so far failed to solve the
Springdale pitcher, the audience expected that Dick
would pull him out and substitute a pinch-hitter—probably
McCoy or Lewis. But, after a momentary
stir at the bench and a quick consultation between
Dick and Haley, Breen advanced to the plate,
bat in hand. Knowing ones in the stands shook
their heads and grumbled, and Fudge emphatically
condemned proceedings and became very pessimistic.
Perry, daring to hint that perhaps, after all,
Dick Lovering had some good reason for allowing
Breen to bat, was silenced by exactly four perfectly
good arguments against such a possibility. By
which time Howard Breen had a ball and a strike
on him, the coachers were jumping and shrieking
and the purple flags were waving madly while several
hundred voices roared out a bedlam of sound.
For it was now or never, in the belief of most,
and a safe hit was needed very, very badly!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>Breen faced Fortune calmly. Perhaps that misjudgment
in right-field—it couldn’t be scored as an
error, but that didn’t take any of the sting out of
it for Howard—had put him on his mettle and endowed
him with a desperate determination to make
atonement. And possibly Dick Lovering was counting
on that very thing. At all events Breen came
through! With one strike and two balls against
him, Breen picked out a wide curve and got it on
the middle of his bat. It was a lucky hit, but it did
the business. It started over Newton’s head, went
up and up, curved toward the foul-line and finally
landed just out of reach of first- and second-basemen
a foot inside the white mark!</p>

<p>And when second-baseman scooped it up Breen
was racing across the bag, Gordon had tallied and
Warner Jones was just sliding into the plate.</p>

<p>For the succeeding three minutes pandemonium
reigned. Purple banners whipped the air, new
straw hats were subjected to outrageous treatment
and caps sailed gloriously into space. At first-base
Bryan was hugging Breen ecstatically and
midway between the plate and the pitcher’s box a
half-dozen Springdale players were holding a rueful
conference. When comparative quiet had returned,
and after Fudge had saved his face by
carefully explaining that Breen’s hit had been the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
luckiest fluke that he, Fudge, had ever witnessed
in a long and eventful life, the game went on.</p>

<p>Newton for the first time showed nerves. Haley,
who was only an average batter at the best, was
sent to first after five deliveries. The Clearfield
cheering, momentarily stilled, broke forth with renewed
vehemence. It was Bryan’s turn at bat.
Bryan stood disdainfully inert while two bad ones
passed him, and then Springdale’s relief pitcher,
who had been warming up off and on for the last
four innings, took the helm and Newton, who had
pitched a remarkable game up to the eighth inning,
retired to the bench.</p>

<p>The new twirler, Crowell, was a right-hander and
was regarded as slightly better than Newton. He
took his time about starting to work, but when he
finally began he finished the performance neatly
enough, causing Bryan to swing at two very poor
offerings and then sneaking a fast one over for the
third strike.</p>

<p>Springdale ought to have realized then and there
that she was beaten. Everyone else did, and there
ensued the beginning of an exodus from the stands.
But those who were on their way out three minutes
after the ninth inning began either scuttled
back to their seats or sought places along the side
of the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>The new pitcher had done the unexpected. Far
out in the field Farrar and Cotner were chasing
back after the rolling ball. Crowell had landed
squarely on Haley’s first pitch and driven it whizzing
past the surprised Captain Jones for three
bases! Tom Haley looked about as astounded as
he ever allowed himself to look as he walked to
the box after backing up Lanny. With none out
and a runner on third, victory looked less certain
for the Purple. Springdale’s “rooters” yelled wildly
and triumphantly and Springdale’s coachers
leaped about like insane acrobats and volleyed all
sorts of advice to the lone runner, most of it intended
for the pitcher’s ears.</p>

<p>“It’s a cinch, Johnny! You can walk home in a
minute! He’s up in the air like a kite! There’s
nothing to it, old man, there’s nothing to it!
Here’s where we roll ’em up! Watch us score!
Hi! Hi! Look at that for a rotten pitch! His
arm’s broken in two places! Just tap it, Hughie,
just tap it! He’s all gone now, old man! He
hasn’t a thing but his glove! Come on now! Let’s
have it! Right down the alley, Hughie! Pick your
place and let her go!”</p>

<p>But Hughie struck out, in spite of all the advice
and encouragement supplied him, also the next
man up, and Clearfield began to breathe a bit easier.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
But the trouble was by no means over, for an inshoot
landed against the ribs of the next batsman
and he ambled to first, solicitously rubbing his side
and grinning at Tom Haley.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” called Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you are!” was the response.</p>

<p>Springdale’s center-fielder, second man on her
batting list, waited until the runner on first had
taken second unchallenged and then lifted a fly to
Breen. The latter got it without altering his position
and pegged to the plate, but Crowell beat out
the throw by a yard and the score was 4 to 3. On
the throw-in the batsman went to second and with
two out and two on bases the infield spread out
again. There was some delay while Springdale
selected a pinch-hitter, and then, when he had
rubbed his hands in the dirt, rubbed the dirt off on
his trousers, gripped his bat and fixed his feet
firmly to earth, all with the grim, determined air
of an eleventh-hour hero, Lanny stepped to one side
of the plate and Tom Haley tossed him four wide
ones!</p>

<p>It was the Blue’s turn to howl derisively and the
Blue did it. And the Purple shouted derisively
back. So much, you see, depends on the point of
view! The bases were filled now and a hit would
not only tie the score but add a second tally to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
Springdale’s column. But neither Lanny nor
Haley appeared worried, not even when the next
batsman appeared in the person of the Blue’s captain
and third-baseman. Still, Tom worked a bit
more deliberately than usual, studied Lanny’s signals
thoughtfully, seemed bent on consuming as
much time as possible. The Blue’s captain swayed
his bat back and forth and strove to restrain his
impatience, but that he was impatient was proved
when Tom’s first delivery, a ball that Lanny picked
almost out of the dirt, fooled him into offering at
it. Clearfield shouted joyfully as the bat swept
harmlessly above the ball and the men on bases
scuttled back. The batsman grew cautious then
and let the next two deliveries pass unheeded,
guessing them correctly. The noise which had been
for some minutes loud and unceasing dwindled to
silence as Tom nodded a reply to Lanny’s signal,
wound up and lurched forward. The Springdale
captain expected a good one and recognized it
when he saw it. Bat and ball met sharply and he
raced down the first base path.</p>

<p>Cries filled the air, the bases emptied. The ball,
smashed directly at Tom Haley, bounded out of
his glove and rolled back toward the third base
line. Tom, momentarily confused, sprang after it,
scooped it up from almost under the feet of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
speeding runner from third and, without a moment’s
indecision, hurled it to Lanny. And <a href="#i_fp286">Lanny,
dropping to his knees on the plate, got it a foot
from the ground</a> just as the spiked shoes of the
runner shot into him. Catcher and runner, blue
stockings and purple, became confusedly mixed up
for a moment, and then Clearfield, seeing the umpire’s
arm swing backward over his shoulder, burst
into triumph and flowed onto the field!</p>

<small>CLEARFIELD CONCEDES THE MEET</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">But Clearfield paid dearly for that victory.</p>

<p>Late Sunday afternoon four dejected
youths sat in the library at Guy Felker’s
house and waited for the report of Skeet Presser,
who had just joined them. Skeet, having stuffed
his cloth cap into his pocket, seated himself and
smiled about him, but the smile was a dispirited
effort.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” asked Guy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him. Just came from there. He’s
in bad shape, Cap. He’s got two cuts just above
his left knee as long as my finger and pretty nearly
to the bone. Ugly wounds they are, the doctor
says. I didn’t see them. He’s all bandaged up.
Anyway, he’s out of it, Guy.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Then:</p>

<p>“Can’t run at all, you think?”</p>

<p>“Run! Great Cæsar’s Ghost, how could any
fellow run with a knee like that? He’ll be lucky<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
if he’s able to catch two weeks from now, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“Catch!” said Guy bitterly. “Confound his
catching! If he hadn’t insisted on doing that he
wouldn’t have been hurt. It’s a nice outlook for the
Track Team, isn’t it? We’ve got about as much
chance to win Saturday as we have of going skating!”</p>

<p>The coach nodded. “That’s right,” he agreed.
“Lanny was good for thirteen points anyway.
Well, I don’t know. Only thing we can do now is
make the best showing possible and——”</p>

<p>“We’re not beaten yet,” said Harry Partridge.
“Kirke’s nearly as fast as Lanny in the sprints,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Nearly, yes,” replied Skeet. “But that’s not
good enough. Springdale’s got fellows nearly as
fast, too. For that matter, that youngster Hull
has been doing some fast work. We may win a
first in one of the sprints; I’m not saying we can’t.
It’s the hurdles that worry me most. Lanny was
down for both and he’d have run them both if
we’d needed him. With Lanny out we’ve got only
Beaton here and Peyton. I’m not throwing off on
you, Beaton, but you’ll have to dig to beat out
Springdale’s best man.”</p>

<p>“I know,” answered the manager, “but, look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
here, Skeet, if we can win one first in the sprints
and get, say, six points out of the hurdles——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be an ass, Arthur,” interrupted Guy
crossly. “You can figure until you get writer’s
cramp, but that doesn’t alter the fact that we’re
dished. As Skeet says, the only thing we can do
is to make Springdale work hard for the meet.
It’s perfectly rotten luck!”</p>

<p>There was another brief silence. Then Toby
Sears asked: “How did Lanny get hurt, anyway?
I didn’t see it. I was so excited——”</p>

<p>“Blocked off that runner of theirs at the plate.
Someone hit a fierce liner at Haley and he knocked
it down and it rolled over toward third base line.
When he got it it was too late to peg to first and he
chucked it to Lanny about a half-second before the
runner got there. Lanny dropped to the plate and
the runner slid feet-first into him and his spikes
ripped right across Lanny’s knee. It was a mighty
pretty piece of blocking, but he ought never to have
taken such a chance.” And Partridge shook his
head dismally.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have hurt anything if they’d taken
that old game,” said Guy bitterly. “They had two
more to play.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Sears, “it would be a good
plan to keep quiet about Lanny’s trouble. There’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
no use in letting Springdale know he can’t run, is
there?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that it matters much whether they
know or don’t know,” said Guy. “They’ll find it
out Saturday.”</p>

<p>“No, Sears is right,” said Skeet thoughtfully.
“We’ll keep it dark. It may disarrange their plans
if they find at the last moment that he isn’t entered.
Did their ball-players know he was hurt badly?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Beaton, “I don’t think so.
Lanny walked to the bench pretty well. A lot of
fellows were with him and I don’t believe Springdale
noticed anything.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll say nothing about it,” said Skeet.
“The doctor told me he’d be around in a couple
of days and Lanny says he’ll come out and do all
he can for us in the way of coaching. I’m going
to get him to take the hurdlers in hand.”</p>

<p>“How does Lanny take it?” asked Harry Partridge.</p>

<p>“Not very well just yet. Rather broken-up
about it. He told me he would rather have won
the sprints than played ball. I wish he’d thought
of that before. Still, I don’t suppose we can expect
the ball team to give up the only first-class
catcher they’ve got to oblige us.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” observed Toby Sears, “it’s a waste of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
time, fellows, but let’s go over the list again and
see if we can figure out a win.”</p>

<p>“Figure all you like,” said the coach as he got
up. “I’ve got to be going, fellows. But when
you’re through figuring just remember that no meet
was ever won with a lead pencil. If you want to
win Saturday just make up your minds that you’re
going to go out there and do about twenty per cent.
better than you ever have done. That’s the only
way you’ll win. See you later.”</p>

<p>So well was the secret of Lanny’s injury kept
that few knew of it until his appearance at the field
on Tuesday. It had been known that Lanny had
been spiked in blocking the plate, but it was not
supposed that he had been seriously hurt, and the
sight of him swinging a stiff left leg about with the
aid of a crutch came as a big surprise. Even then,
however, Lanny laughingly denied that he was
badly injured. “Just a couple of scratches,” he
said, “but they make my leg sort of stiff while
they’re healing. And I don’t want to take any
chances, you know.”</p>

<p>That sounded all right, but by Thursday the
truth somehow got out and the school in general,
by this time quite enthusiastic over the dual meet,
discussed it with dismay and disappointment.
With Lanny out of the meet Clearfield had, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
decided, absolutely no chance of victory, and fellows
who had intended to remain at home and view
Springdale’s defeat on cinders and turf now decided
to accompany the baseball team on Saturday.
“No good staying around here and seeing Springdale
lick the stuffing out of us. Let’s go over there
and root for the Nine.”</p>

<p>Fudge was one who predicted overwhelming defeat
for the Purple. He figured it out for Mr. Addicks
and Perry one day and proved conclusively
that the best possible score for Clearfield was thirty-two
points. “And that,” explained Fudge, “means
that we’ll have to get eight points in the hammer-throw.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Perry, “we’ll make a better showing
than we expect, Fudge. Mander almost equaled
Felker’s record at the pole-vault yesterday.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Fudge firmly. “I’ve
allowed us six points in the pole-vault. We’re going
to get licked good and hard. I’m sorry for
Guy Felker, too. He’s worked pretty hard ever
since last year. Remember how he got fellows out
in the fall and made them work? Everyone
laughed at him then, but if it wasn’t for Lanny
getting hurt Guy would have shown them something.
We’d have won easily if the meet had been
last Saturday instead of next.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve seen it happen more than once,” observed
Mr. Addicks, “that a team with a heavy handicap
has gone in and won. Seems like knowing you’ve
<em>got</em> to work helps a heap sometimes. Don’t give
in yet, Fudge.”</p>

<p>The last work for the Track Team came Thursday.
There had been time-trials for the runners
Monday and some pretty strenuous work for all
hands on Wednesday, but Thursday’s practice was
little more than a warming up. Mr. Addicks, however,
wasn’t in favor of letting down too soon,
and on Friday morning Perry was out on the track
as usual and was put through his paces quite as
vigorously as on any other morning. On Friday
afternoon the track men went for a short run across
country and that ended the season’s work.</p>

<p>While Clearfield still looked for a defeat on the
morrow, it no longer conceded the meet to Springdale
by any overwhelming majority of points, and
there were others beside Arthur Beaton who even
dared hope for a victory by a narrow margin.
Captain Felker, however, was not one of these.
Guy faced the inevitable grimly, determined to at
least make a good showing. Lanny worked hard
with the coaching and under his tuition the two
hurdlers, Beaton and Peyton, showed improvement
by Thursday. So far no inkling had reached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
Springdale of Lanny’s trouble and his name had
been included in the list of Clearfield entrants
which was sent to Springdale three days before the
meet. Springdale’s list included thirty-one names
and she had entered at least four fellows in each
event. For the sprints and hurdles the number
was six. Guy shook his head dismally over that
list.</p>

<p>Saturday morning Perry slept late for the first
time in many days, and after breakfast went over
to Mr. Addicks’ rooms and listened to final instructions.
He was a little bit jumpy to-day. When
Mr. Addicks had delivered the last of his advice
he suggested that Perry accompany him across the
river and watch him work. “The walk will do
you good,” he said. “If you get bored you can
come back whenever you like.”</p>

<p>Fudge came in before they got started and went
along. Fudge was about as nervous as a block of
wood. He was very full of the impending affair
but quite untroubled. The only thing that seemed
to really matter to Fudge was his chance of beating
Falkland in the hammer-throw. Whether he out-tossed
the Springdale fellows apparently failed to
bother him. The boys remained with Mr. Addicks
until the middle of the morning, and then,
extracting a promise from him that he would attend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
the meet, they returned across the river and, a
little later, witnessed the departure of the ball team
for Springdale, doing their share of the cheering
as the special trolley-car moved away from the
Square. After all, only a small number of fellows
accompanied the Nine, most of them, for one reason
or another, deciding to stand by the Track
Team. Dinner was early to-day and Perry was
far from hungry. But Fudge, who had accepted
Mrs. Hull’s invitation, did full justice to the
viands, as observed wonderingly and rather enviously
by his host.</p>

<p>The program was to start at two-thirty and long
before that the two boys were dressed and waiting.
The day was fair and hot, unseasonably hot
for so early in June. By a little after two the
stands were already well sprinkled with spectators.
The Springdale team was late in arriving and it
was almost twenty minutes to three when the entrants
in the hundred-yards-dash were summoned
to the starting line. Perry, who had been restlessly
circulating about the field for a half-hour, followed
the others with his heart thumping uncomfortably.
It suddenly occurred to him that he was
about to take part in his first real race, and that
his effort was to be witnessed by nearly a thousand
persons. He looked across the field and down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
it to the crowded stands, where purple and blue
pennants made spots of color in the hot sunlight,
and for a moment wished himself far away. Then
the names were being called for the first heat and he
forgot the watchers. To his relief, he was not
summoned. Neither was Lanny. Kirke and Soper
were on the track with three Springdale runners
when the whistle was blown. There was a minute
of silence. Then the starter’s voice sounded crisply.</p>

<p>“Ready!... Set!...”</p>

<p>The pistol barked.</p>

<small>SPRINGDALE LEADS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“<em>Go it, Kirke!</em>”</p>

<p>Perry turned to find Lanny at his elbow,
Lanny enveloped in a brown bath-robe and
minus his crutch. Then the shouts of the crowd
at the finish drew Perry’s gaze down the track
again as the flying figures crossed the line. From
back there it was hard to say who had been placed,
but presently, as the sprinters returned, Lanny hurried
stiffly to meet Kirke.</p>

<p>“All right, Orson?” called Lanny. Kirke shook
his head, smiling and panting.</p>

<p>“I’m out,” he answered. “Soper’s placed,
though. I was fourth.”</p>

<p>“Hard luck,” said Lanny. “You’ll make it in
the two-twenty, though.” He returned to where
Perry was standing. “Funny that Kirke let Soper
beat him,” he said. “He’s been finishing ahead of
Soper right along, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I think Kirke’s better in the two-twenty.
Are you going to run, Lanny?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>Lanny pursed his mouth grimly. “I don’t believe
it will be running, but I’m going to start just
for fun.”</p>

<p>“But won’t it hurt your leg?” asked Perry anxiously.</p>

<p>“Doc says so, but he’s an old granny. I won’t
be able to finish, I guess, but I hate not to have a
shot at it.”</p>

<p>“Griner!” called the Clerk of the Course.
“Stratton! Stratton?”</p>

<p>“Withdrawn,” someone answered. The Clerk’s
pencil went through the name.</p>

<p>“White?”</p>

<p>“Here,” replied Lanny as he took his place.</p>

<p>“Powers?”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hill?”</p>

<p>“That should be Hull, sir,” said Lanny.</p>

<p>“Hull?”</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” replied Perry, joining the others.</p>

<p>“That’s all, then, Mr. Starter. Only four.”</p>

<p>“Are you all ready, boys?” asked the starter.
“On your marks! Hold on there, Number 7!
Don’t try that or you’ll get set back. On your
marks!... Set!...”</p>

<p>The pistol banged and the four jumped away.
Perry, on the outer side of the straightaway, was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
his stride the first of the three and, halfway down
the track, shot a side-long look at the others. Lanny
was not in sight, but the nearer Springdale youth
was a yard or so behind and the further one running
about even. As the first three were to be
placed, Perry slowed up and took it easy, finishing
a close third. Half way down the track Lanny was
being helped over the strings to the turf. Perry,
turning back, heard a timer say laughingly: “Fast
time, Jim; ten and four-fifths!” Lanny was seated
on the turf ruefully holding his injured knee when
Perry reached him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Lanny,” he said. “Did you fall?”</p>

<p>“No, I just found I couldn’t do it, Perry. How’s
the track?”</p>

<p>“Fine! Say, I wish Kirke had got placed.
They’ve got four to our two in the final.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, you or Soper will get a first.
Those chaps aren’t fast. Give me a pull up, will
you?”</p>

<p>Perry got back into his dressing-gown and joined
the throng across the field, at the finish of the 440-yards.
Sears, Todd and Cranston lined up for the
Purple in the quarter-mile and Springdale placed
five runners at the mark, amongst them Davis, the
Blue’s captain. It was Davis who took the lead at
the end of the first hundred yards and, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
hard-pressed by Toby Sears and a second Springdale
runner, kept it to the tape. At the turn Davis
was two yards to the good and Sears was leading
the third man by a scant two feet. Todd was in
fifth place and the other Clearfield entrant in seventh.
At the beginning of the stretch Sears gained
half the distance separating him from Davis, and
until well down the track it looked as if he might
get the lead. Davis, however, had plenty of reserve
and forty yards from the finish it was evident
that Sears had shot his bolt. Davis finished
first by three yards and a second Springdale runner
ousted Sears from second place almost at the tape.
Springdale had made a good start with eight points
to Clearfield’s one, and the Blue’s adherents cheered
approvingly.</p>

<p>The high hurdles followed and again Springdale
triumphed, getting first and third place. Beaton
finished second but was disqualified for upsetting
too many hurdles, and Peyton got the honor.
The time was eighteen seconds flat and bettered the
dual meet record by a fifth of a second.</p>

<p>In the final of the 100-yards dash Perry and
Soper were opposed to four wearers of the blue.
Perry, digging his holes, tried to recall all the
good advice Mr. Addicks had given him, but
couldn’t remember much of anything. His heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
was beating very fast, and he was as nearly frightened
as he had been for a long time. He looked
over at Soper, who had drawn the inside lane, and
saw that even that more experienced runner was
plainly nervous. Then the starter’s voice came and
Perry settled his toes in the holes, crouched and
waited.</p>

<p>“Set!”</p>

<p>Some over-anxious Springdale sprinter leaped
away and it had all to be gone through with again.
But at last the pistol sounded and Perry, without
knowing just how he had got there, found himself
well down the track, his legs flying, his arms pumping
up and forward and down and back, his lungs
working like a pair of bellows and the cries and
exhortations of the spectators in his ears. A youth
with blue stripes down the seams of his fluttering
trunks was a good yard in the lead and Perry, with
three others, next. Someone, and Perry silently
hoped it wasn’t Soper, was no longer in sight.
Perry put the last gasp of breath and last ounce of
strength into the final twenty yards in a desperate
effort to overtake that Springdale runner, but it
wasn’t until they were almost at the tape that he
knew he had gone ahead, and then, as he threw
his arms up, a third white-clad figure flashed past!</p>

<p>A half-minute later Perry learned that Soper had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
won and that he had finished in second place by a
scant two feet. Soper’s time was ten and a fifth.
Perry had feared that the form which had flashed
to the front at the tape had been that of a Springdale
runner and was so relieved that it didn’t occur
to him until some time later to either regret
that he had not finished in first place or congratulate
himself on capturing second. But Guy Felker,
after hugging Soper, almost wrung Perry’s hand
off.</p>

<p>“That was bully!” he repeated over and over.
“That was bully! We get eight out of it and didn’t
count on more than four! You’re all right, Hull!
Better rest up now, boy. Remember the two-twenty’s
coming. Hello, Lanny! What do you
say to that? Wasn’t it bully?”</p>

<p>Perry received Lanny’s praise and, rather embarrassed,
went back for his robe. He wondered if
Mr. Addicks had seen him, and he tried to catch
sight of that gentleman in the audience. But half
the folks were still standing on their feet and shouting
and it was no use. He wished Mr. Addicks
might have been down here on the field to-day.
As he passed the blackboard a boy was writing the
new figures down.</p>

<p>“Clearfield, 12; Springdale, 15,” was the announcement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>He tried to figure out how that could be, but was
far too excited. When he had wrapped his robe
around him he went back to the dressing-room for
a rub, crossing the track just ahead of the half-milers
who were coming around the turn. He
stopped and watched them pass. Todd was running
in third place, hugging the rim closely, and
Lasker was on his heels. Train was one of a bunch
of four who trailed a couple of yards back. Springdale
had entered five men to Clearfield’s three.
Perry missed the finish of the half-mile, but Beaton
brought the news into the dressing-room presently.
Only Lasker had been placed, winning second.
Linn of Springdale had finished first by nearly
thirty yards in two minutes, eight and two-fifths
seconds. Todd had been in the lead for the whole
of the third lap but hadn’t been able to keep it. He
and Train had been a half-lap behind at the end.</p>

<p>“What’s the score now, Arthur?” asked someone.</p>

<p>Beaton shook his head wryly. “Springdale’s
about twenty-one, I think, to our fifteen. We’ve
got to begin and do something pretty soon. Guy’s
got first in the high-jump cinched, though. They’re
almost through.”</p>

<p>“How’s the shot-put getting on?” Perry asked.</p>

<p>“Not finished yet,” replied Beaton. “I guess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
they’ve got it, though.” He hurried out in response
to imperative requests for low hurdlers, and
Perry followed presently. The 220-yards-hurdle
trials had brought out seven entrants and so two
preliminary dashes were necessary. Fortunately,
perhaps, the two Clearfield candidates, Beaton and
Peyton, were not drawn for the same trial. As a
result Peyton easily won in his event from three
Springdale fellows and Arthur Beaton finished second
without hurrying in the next trial. Then the
hurdles were quickly lifted aside and the milers began
to assemble at the starting point.</p>

<p>Springdale had been conceded this event two
weeks ago, but in his last time-trial Smith, of Clearfield,
had gone over the course in the commendable
time of five minutes and six and two-fifths seconds
and the Purple was entertaining a secret hope
that Smith might somehow prove too good for the
Blue’s crack runner. Eight fellows started, three
for Clearfield and five for Springdale. The policy
of the latter school was evidently to start as many
fellows in each event as possible on the chance of
displacing a Clearfield entrant. In the present case
it was speedily apparent that at least two of Springdale’s
milers were not expected to finish.</p>

<p>At the end of the first of the four laps the race
had settled into two divisions—Smith, Toll and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
Tupper, wearers of the purple C, running well
ahead with an equal number of Springdale fellows,
and the other two of the Blue’s force lagging a
hundred yards behind. Wallace, the Springdale
hope, was allowing one of his teammates to set the
pace and was right on his heels. Two feet behind
him trotted Smith, followed by Tupper, a third
Springdale runner, and Toll. The six were hugging
the rim and watching each other craftily. In
that order they passed around the first turn. Then
Toll began to go ahead and the challenge was accepted
by the third Springdale man. Toll finally
ran even with Wallace in the backstretch and on
the next turn dropped into the lead.</p>

<p>The half-distance found daylight between Wallace
and Smith, and the former pace-maker fell
back into fourth place. At the turn Toll began
to hit it up. Wallace sped close behind him. Smith
came next, some four yards back. Strung out behind
Smith were a second blue runner, Tupper,
and, dropping back every moment, the last Springdale
runner. In that order they came down the
straightaway, passed the mark and went doggedly
on, to the ringing of the gong announcing the last
lap. The stands were shouting confusedly. The
leaders passed the two lagging Springdale runners
before the turn was begun. As Toll led the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
into the backstretch it was evident that he was
about done for and a rod or two further along
Smith fairly leaped into the lead, taking Wallace
by surprise. But the three or four yards which he
gained were quickly cut down. Tupper closed in
on Wallace but could not pass him, and as the next
turn was reached began to fall back.</p>

<p>Smith, with Wallace close on his heels, entered
the straightaway, running desperately. Behind
him, some ten yards back, came a second Springdale
man, and, twenty yards or so behind him, Tupper
and a third wearer of the blue were fighting it
out. For a moment it seemed that Smith might
win, but fifty yards from the tape Wallace uncorked
a sprint that swept him past Smith and well
into the lead, while the next Springdale runner,
head back, challenged Smith for second place and
slowly closed up the distance between them. Wallace
crossed a good six yards ahead and Smith, running
now on pure nerve, saw the second blue adversary
edge past him a few feet from the line.</p>

<p>Smith staggered as he crossed and fell limply
into the outstretched arms of Skeet. Tupper finished
fourth, almost as exhausted, and the others
trailed in one by one. The pace had been a fast
one, the winner’s time being caught at five minutes,
five and one-fifth seconds, and Smith, finishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
third, had run the distance well under his best
record.</p>

<p>By that time the result of the high-jump was
being announced, and Clearfield had won first place
and halved third. Felker had cleared the bar at
five feet and six inches, a Springdale jumper had
secured second place with five feet and five and a
half inches and Todd had tied with a Springdale
fellow at five-feet-four. A moment later the figures
showing the score were changed again. With
just half the events decided, Clearfield had 21½
points and Springdale 32½.</p>

<small>THE PURPLE PENNANT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was getting well along toward five o’clock
and the sun was sending slanting rays down
Brent Field. The two-twenty-dash trials had
been run and the final in the low hurdles was just
over. In the former Perry, Kirke and Soper had
all won places and in the latter Beaton and Peyton
had finished first and second and added eight more
points to the Clearfield score. The broad-jump
and shot-put, too, were over and the Blue had won
first and third places in the former and first place
in the latter. Partridge had been a good second
in the weight event and Brimmer a poor third. In
the broad-jump Toby Sears had captured three
points. Only the pole-vault, the two-twenty-dash
and the hammer-throw remained and the score
stood: Clearfield, 36½; Springdale, 44½.</p>

<p>A moment ago the result of the ball game at
Springdale had come over the wire and had been
announced, and Clearfield was feeling somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
dejected. Springdale had won, 8 to 2. That and
the dismal outlook here at the field had caused the
purple banners to droop on their staffs. But there
was one purple flag that still flaunted itself bravely
in the lengthening rays of sunlight. It hung from
the railing of the stand on the third base side of the
field, a handsome pennant of royal purple with a
wreath of green laurel leaves on it enclosing the
letters “C. H. S.” Behind it sat Louise Brent and
a bevy of her companions. The girls were in a
quandary. Already several Track Team heroes
were tied in the number of points gained by them
and the task of awarding the pennant promised to
be an extremely difficult one. If Guy Felker won
the pole-vault, which was possible at the present
stage, the matter would be simplified, for he would
then have ten points to his credit, two more than
anyone else. The girls discussed the difficulty and
referred again and again to the score that Louise
was keeping, but without finding a way out of the
quandary.</p>

<p>“There’s just one thing to do,” said Dick Lovering’s
sister, Grace, finally. “It was understood that
the pennant was to go to the boy doing the most
for the school, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>The others assented doubtfully. “I suppose that
was what was meant,” said Louise, “but I thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
we could give it to someone who had made more
points than anyone else and that it would be all
quite simple. But with three and maybe four fellows
making eight——”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” said Grace. “We can’t ask
them to toss up for it or draw lots, can we? So
the best thing to do is to decide after it’s all over
which of them really did the best.”</p>

<p>“But how can we decide that?” asked May Burnham.
“How are we to know which did the best?”</p>

<p>“We can,” replied Grace convincedly. “Guy and
the others will know if we don’t.”</p>

<p>“Guy will have ten points himself if he wins
the pole-vault,” said Louise. “That would make
it very simple.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’s going to,” said another girl.
“He’s just missed that try, and I think that long-legged
Springdale boy did it a minute ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, if he doesn’t!” exclaimed Louise
hopelessly. “There, he’s gone and missed it again!
No, he hasn’t! He hasn’t! He went over! Oh,
<em>do</em> you think that makes him win?”</p>

<p>Evidently it didn’t, for while Guy was being congratulated
by those around the vaulting standard
the bar was again raised and a boy with a megaphone
announced: “The bar is now at ten feet
one and one-half inches!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>But interest was drawn from the prolonged
struggle there to the track. At the beginning of
the straightaway they were gathering the contestants
in the final of the two-hundred-and-twenty-yards-dash,
the last of the track events. Clearfield
and Springdale had each placed three men in the
trials. For Clearfield these were Perry Hull, Kirke
and Soper; for Springdale, Knight, Lawrence and
Gedge. The trials had been done in twenty-four
and three-fifths and twenty-four and four-fifths,
rather slow time, but the final promised to show
faster performances. It was figured that if Captain
Felker could win five points in the pole-vault
and the Purple’s sprinters could capture first and
second places in the two-twenty, Clearfield might
after all squeeze out a victory, for Partridge was
counted on to have a very good chance to get the
best there was in the hammer-throw, which had
been going on for some time in the field across the
way. But it was necessary to get eight points in
the sprint, as it was reckoned, and there were few
who dared hope for such a result. Kirke, it was
generally conceded, might possibly win first place,
but there were two good runners in the Springdale
trio who would certainly make a showing.</p>

<p>Perry drew the fourth lane, with Lawrence of
Springdale on his left and Orson Kirke on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
right. Kirke looked grimly determined and Perry
was pretty sure that he meant to win. And,
thought Perry, since he had failed in the hundred
he really deserved to. But Perry was not yet conceding
the race. He had made mistakes in his first
race. He had realized it afterwards. Now he
meant to profit by what he had learned. He wasn’t
so frightened this time, either. He had been
through the fire.</p>

<p>The crowd about the start drew back to the turf
and a whistle shrilled. Down at the finish a handkerchief
waved response. The six boys stopped
prancing and settled to their places. The starter
stepped back.</p>

<p>“On your marks!”</p>

<p>Perry, settling his toes into the cinders, heard the
click of the pistol hammer as it was drawn back.
There was a sudden silence.</p>

<p>“Set!”</p>

<p>An instant’s pause and then the pistol spoke
sharply and the race was on. Six lithe, white-clad
forms launched themselves forward, twelve arms
beat the air and twelve legs twinkled. Three of the
six had drawn ahead in the first lunge, Perry and
Kirke amongst them. Twenty yards away the field
was already strung out. Kirke, running terrifically,
was a yard to the good. Perry and Lawrence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
were next. Soper was a yard or so behind them.
But that order changed again in the next few seconds.
Perry was breasting Kirke then and Lawrence
was almost even with them. Soper was
making bad going and falling back. The shouts of
the crowd in the stands and around the finish made
a crashing bedlam of sound that drowned completely
the quick <em>scrunch-scrunch</em> of the runners’
shoes and their hoarse breathing.</p>

<p>Now it was half-distance, and Perry saw the
white figure at his right fall back and felt rather
than saw another form crawling up and up on the
other side near the rim. Lawrence held on, too,
and fifty yards from the finish Perry, Lawrence and
Gedge were neck-and-neck, with Kirke a single
pace behind. Soper and Knight were already
beaten. Then Gedge forged ahead and the wild
shouts of the Springdale contingent took on new
vigor. Cries of “<em>Clearfield! Clearfield!</em>” “<em>Springdale!
Springdale!</em>” filled the air. Dimly, Perry
heard his own name over and over.</p>

<p>Now the slim white thread was rushing up the
track toward him. He had no sense of moving
himself, although his lungs were aching and his
arms swung back and forth and his legs, suddenly
weighted with lead, still spurned the track. It was
as though he, in spite of the painful efforts he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
making, was standing still and the finish line was
racing toward him! For a moment he wondered
about Kirke, but for a moment only. The tape
was but twenty yards away now and it was time
for the last supreme endeavor.</p>

<p>Gedge was two paces in front when Perry started
his final rush. In ten yards he was level. In five
more he was back with Lawrence. <a href="#i_frontis">Like a white
streak Perry breasted the string</a>, his arms thrown
up, his head back, and after him came Gedge and
Lawrence, Kirke, Knight and Soper.</p>

<p>Once over the line, Perry staggered, recovered
and then fell, rolling limply across the cinders. A
dozen eager boys rushed to his assistance and he
was lifted and borne to the turf where, a moment
later, he found his breath.</p>

<p>“Kirke?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer. “They got second and
third. You broke the dual record, Hull; twenty-three
and four-fifths!”</p>

<p>Perry considered that an instant in silence.
Then: “We lose the meet, though, don’t we?”</p>

<p>His informant nodded. “Suppose so. There’s
still the hammer-throw, but I guess we’re dished.
It isn’t your fault, though. You ran a peach of
a race, Hull!”</p>

<p>Perry climbed weakly to his feet, with assistance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
and found that at last he could take a long
breath again. “I’m sorry about Kirke,” he said
rather vaguely.</p>

<p>“Are you?” gasped a voice behind him. “So’m
I, but glad you won, Perry!” It was Kirke himself.
Perry shook hands with him and then others
pushed around for the same purpose; Lawrence
and Gedge of Springdale, and Arthur Beaton and
Toby Sears and several others, and, finally, Skeet,
Skeet with puzzled admiration written large on his
thin face.</p>

<p>“I never knew you had it in you, Hull!” he declared,
wringing Perry’s hand. “Kid, you made
a fine finish! I thought it was all over ten yards
from the tape, and then, bing!—you left him
standing! But don’t stay around here and get stiff.
Beat it to the shower!”</p>

<p>“Wait! What’s the score, please?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re fifty-two and a half to our forty-six
and a half. Cap got first in the pole-vault, but
Mander wasn’t placed. They’ve got the meet, all
right, but we made ’em fight for it!”</p>

<p>“Fifty-two?” repeated Perry, puzzled. “But
don’t they have to have more than fifty-four to
win?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the hammer-throw isn’t finished yet.
They’ll get three in that, anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p>Perry looked around. The field was already
emptying. “I’ll get my dressing-gown, I guess,”
he said.</p>

<p>“All right, but don’t stand around too long,” said
Skeet. “I’m going over to see them finish the hammer.
Better luck next year, Hull.”</p>

<p>He nodded and joined the throng straggling
through the gate. Perry hurried back up the field
and found his dressing-gown and then, disregarding
Skeet’s suggestion, he too followed the crowd
to where, on the lot behind the field, it had spread
itself in a half-circle around the group of hammer-throwers.
Perry wedged himself through to where
he could see a little.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said a voice at his elbow and he looked
up into Lanny’s smiling countenance. “You ran a
great race, Perry. I wasn’t needed to-day after
all, was I?” He found Perry’s hand and clasped
it warmly. “Your time bettered the best I ever
made in my life. Next year you’ll have them
standing on their heads, or I’m a Dutchman!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” murmured Perry. “I guess I
wouldn’t have beaten you, Lanny, if you’d been
there. How—how is this coming out? Is there
any chance for us to get the meet?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not. Partridge did a hundred and
thirty-one and eight inches, I believe, and no one’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
come near him. But that big chap of theirs will
get second, I guess. Fudge Shaw is right after
him, though. There’s Springdale’s last try.”</p>

<p>Perry, standing on tip-toe, saw the hammer go
flying off, but couldn’t see where it landed.</p>

<p>“The worst he’s done yet,” exclaimed Lanny.
“By Jove, I wonder——”</p>

<p>There was a sudden stir of excitement about
them. “If Shaw can better his last throw,” a voice
nearby said, “we may have a chance yet. But he’s
got to beat a hundred and twenty-four and something!”</p>

<p>“Is Fudge still in it?” asked Perry wonderingly.
Lanny nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s been doing well, too. So far he’s only
six feet behind the Springdale chap, I understand.
I only got here about five minutes ago. There’s
Guy Felker over there with the pennant the girls
gave him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did he win it? I’m glad of that. How
many points did he make, Lanny?”</p>

<p>“Ten; first in the high-jump and pole-vault.
Here goes Harry again.”</p>

<p>Partridge walked into the circle, dragging his
hammer, and the measurer, far out across the
field, scuttled for safety, the yellow tape fluttering
behind him. The crowd laughed and then grew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
silent. Partridge spun and the weight went hurtling
through the air. But the result failed to equal his
best throw.</p>

<p>“Now comes Fudge,” whispered Lanny. “Gee,
but I wish he might beat that Springdale chap. If
we could get second place out of this we’d have
the meet!”</p>

<p>“Would we?” asked Perry, startled. “I
thought——”</p>

<p>“Eight points would give us fifty-four and a
half,” said Lanny, “and that would be enough,
wouldn’t it? Funny Falkland is out of it. I
thought he was almost as good as Harry.”</p>

<p>Perry, dodging behind the heads and shoulders in
front of him, saw Fudge throwing off his dressing-gown
and step, a rotund but powerful-looking
youth, into the ring. Applause greeted him.
Fudge glanced around and was seen to wink
gravely at someone in the throng. Then he placed
the ball of the hammer at the back of the ring,
closed his fingers about the handle and raised his
shoulders. Silence fell once more and anxious
faces watched as the hammer came off the ground
and began to swing, slowly at first and then faster
and faster above the whitewashed circle. Fudge’s
feet sped around, shifting like a dancer’s, until he
was well toward the front of the ring. Then his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
sturdy young body set suddenly, his hands opened
and off shot the flying weight, arching through the
air, to come to earth at last far across the sunlit
field.</p>

<p>The crowd broke and hurried to cluster about
the ring, excited voices speculating eagerly on the
distance. Out where the hammer had plowed
into the sod the measurer was stooping with the
tape. Then:</p>

<p>“All right here!” he called.</p>

<p>A breathless moment followed. Heads bent
close above the official as he tautened his end of
the tape over the wooden rim.</p>

<p>“One hundred,” announced the judge, “and ...
twenty ... five feet and....”</p>

<p>But what the inches were Perry didn’t hear. A
wild shout of rejoicing arose from the friends of
Clearfield. Fudge had won second place and Clearfield
had captured the meet!</p>

<p>After that all was confusion and noise. Perry
suddenly found himself shaking hands laughingly
with Mr. Addicks, although what the latter said
he couldn’t hear. Then his attention was attracted
to a commotion nearby as the crowd pushed
and swayed. On the shoulders of excited, triumphant
schoolmates, Fudge, half in and half out of
his crimson robe, was being borne past. He espied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
Perry and waved to him, and Perry forced his way
through the throng just as Guy Felker reached up
and placed the purple pennant in Fudge’s hand.</p>

<p>“W-w-w-what’s this?” stammered Fudge.</p>

<p>“It’s yours, Fudge!” shouted Guy. “You’ve won
the meet and you get the pennant!”</p>

<p>“B-b-but I d-d-didn’t w-w-win this, d-d-did I?”
gasped Fudge.</p>

<p>“You bet!”</p>

<p>“W-w-well, but wh-wh-why?”</p>

<p>“Because we needed three points to win the meet,
you old idiot,” laughed Guy, “and you got them
for us!”</p>

<p>“And,” supplemented a voice that sounded like
Curtis Wayland’s, “for numerous other reasons!”</p>

<p>And Fudge, borne forward again, waving the
purple pennant high in air, had the grace to blush.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
